This powerful amulet is able to siphon energy from the Emerald Dream, bestowing luck upon those who carry it.Sadly, I have not been able to retrieve it from my dresser in Starbreeze Village... Although Starbreeze was once a tranquil place, it has now succumbed to the corruption of the furbolg that reside there.Perhaps you would be willing to recover my dreamcatcher, <class>? ",
