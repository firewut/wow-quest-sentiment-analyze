Taller than a wave in a windstorm, with a beard like a kelp forest and a hammer like an oak tree.He taunts me from Janeiro's Point, the island right off the end of this very pier.  It's because of him that I'm still trapped here, living this lamentable landlubber's life.If you can swim, then head out to Janeiro's Point and slay Mok'rash.Take care, <name>.  Mok'rash will not lay down as easily as his brothers.",
