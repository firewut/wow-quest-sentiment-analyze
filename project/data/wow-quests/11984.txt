We've had to find ways to make it on our own, and today that means sellin' trolls to the highest bidder.Fortunately, we've recently found a use for Budd. Something about his condition allows him to mingle with the local trolls, so we taught him a little game that's turned us a tidy profit.See for yourself. Talk to Budd, take him southwest to Drak'Zin Ruins and use this cage as soon as he tags a troll.",
