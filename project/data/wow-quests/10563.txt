Our hopes are riding on you, <name>.What little information we've been able to gather indicates that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold. With the help of a disguise I'll give you, you must sneak into Legion Hold and learn about their plans. Your best hope is to intercept or overhear communication between their commanders. Good luck, <name>.",
