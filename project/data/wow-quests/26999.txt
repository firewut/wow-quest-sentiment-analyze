The earth flowers, the trees grow tall and green, and the wildlife is beginning to return.  Yet a few remnants of undeath remain.While the trees and grass prosper, the animals are struggling.  Something is preventing them from healing, and I intend to find out what.  Bring me samples from the plagued wildlife so that I may study them more closely.",
