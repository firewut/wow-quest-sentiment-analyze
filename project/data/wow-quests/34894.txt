    "description": "Many years ago I had a life-mate, Dahaka. We were only bound a short time before she was taken from me.I have lived long, but I have never known greater pain than that day. I was young and my grief was great; the earth quaked beneath my rage. I laid her to rest upon this cliff.It is here where I too will rest, but first a favor.A rare bloom grows in a cave within the fiery, molten earth of the plateau. It was her favorite.I would lay the flower upon her grave one last time before I die.",
