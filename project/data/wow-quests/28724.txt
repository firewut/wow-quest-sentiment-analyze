I can tend to him to keep his state from deteriorating, but I need someone to gather an ingredient to prepare him an antidote.All around the ponds you should find Moonpetal Lilies. These flowers have great healing properties, and I can use them with the ingredients I already have to restore Iverron to better health.Would you gather them for me?  There should be many just in sight of here, near the water's edge.",
