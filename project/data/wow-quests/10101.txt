It was there that our shaman communed with the honored ancestors. It was the center of our culture - until the shadows overtook us. When the clans became a horde, the spirits of Oshu'gun fell silent. The ancestors turned their backs on us.Yet something now draws them from their rest. Venture to Oshu'gun and discover what could trouble the spirits so.",
