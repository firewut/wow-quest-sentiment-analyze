General Thorg'izog says we'll be moving out into Redridge soon, and I won't be caught with my kodos down.Use this horn near a kodo.  It will return to the camp when it hears the call.You'll want to watch out.  Sometimes the kodos get a little feisty, so you need to knock them around a bit before they listen to you.",
