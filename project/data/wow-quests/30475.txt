Mah always said that he was one of the best farmers in the valley, though.I think I know the perfect gift for a mean, kind of scary guy like him.There's some big plainshawks that circle the hills to the west of here. You should get one, find a big piece of meat, and then ask Kol Ironpaw to grill it up!",
