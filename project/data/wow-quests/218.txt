The trolls, confused as they are right now, still would like to kick the dwarves right out of Coldridge.  And I'm certainly not going to let some fiery demon turn our snowy valley into a mountain lake.The troll leader, his servants, and the fire creature should all be in the cave to the southeast.  Take 'em all out.",
