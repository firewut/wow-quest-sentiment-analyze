The area is now freed of the Scourge.However, there are still many specters of the past that, for some reason, have not passed on into the next world.  They may be mourning, they may have unfinished business... or they may just be lost.Take my thurible and use it to douse them with holy incense.  One way or another, we will help them move onto the next plane.",
