Our stories tell of how Issliruk fought against a hundred worgs to save his young.It is time for us, too, to fight against our foes to save our brethren.  We will need to craft new weapons.  The horns of the frostwing chimaera that make their home in the snowy parts of the island are sharp and are easily crafted into spear tips.  Bring me the best of these horns that you can find.",
