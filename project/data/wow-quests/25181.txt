The shaman should've arrived on one of the recent zeppelin flights and I'm starting to get worried.He was to meet me by the zeppelin tower southwest of Orgrimmar's gates, but I don't want to miss my audience with the warchief. Would you be willing to look for the courier and see what's delaying him?",
