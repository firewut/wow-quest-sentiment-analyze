Leafing through the pages, you discover dozens of notes, diagrams, and maps.The author's handwriting seems vaguely familiar, but you're unable to place it until you discover an entry signed with the name of Brann Bronzebeard.The back half of the book, containing the most recent entries, has been torn away. Pages litter the battlefield, and it will be impossible to know what Brann discovered here until the book is whole again.",
