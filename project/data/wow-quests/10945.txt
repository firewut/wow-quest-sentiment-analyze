She told me that she ended up in the orphanage because she had to run away from an evil fungal giant and got lost.We had great fun until her people came and took her away last year.  I think she said she was going to live at a place called Sporeggar.I'd like to go to see her and have a look at her mushroom village.  The orphan matron told me that it is on the west side of Zangarmarsh, between the Sporewind and Marshlight lakes.Can we go?  Can we go?  Please?!",
