Our beer level here in Anvilmar is dangerously low.Lucky for us, we've stowed some backup kegs for just such an occasion.  West of Anvilmar, along the valley's northern border, ye'll find kegs of Stormhammer Stout and Theramore Pale Ale.  Just to the east of here, ye'll find a stash of Gnomenbrau.  That's me personal favorite.",
