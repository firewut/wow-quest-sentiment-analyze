All we have now are a few bottles of rum, and it won't sustain a thirsty expedition!We need to get some booze cooking, and fast!!The trees in the Wildgrowth Mangal, to the east, seem laden with fruit, but it's too high for me to reach. Look for good, strong vines, see if you can use it to shake some of that fruit out of the trees. Bring me whatever you can find.",
