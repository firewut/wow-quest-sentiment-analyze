He expects a repeat performance here and asked us to keep an eye out for anyone using a crystal to access the console inside.  Overseer Seylanna holds the access crystal, we're sure of it.Go back in there and finish the operation.  No need to be stealthy anymore; get the crystal, begin the shutdown, kill the technicians trying to stop you and get out.Hurry, it won't be long before Kael's lapdogs sniff us out.",
