Without more, these people here will risk succumbing to their thirst, and eventually becoming withered.\r\n\r\nI am dedicated to preventing this for as long as possible.\r\n\r\nThere is a woman by the name of Deline who owns and operates a small delivery service out of her gondola.\r\n\r\nFind her, identify yourself as my messenger, and offer your aid in acquiring the next shipment.",
