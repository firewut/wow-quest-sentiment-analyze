Furthermore, I don't like the fact that they employ mercenaries like yourself.Nothing against you personally, <class>.  It's just that you could be doing so much more for yourself.  If you're interested in healing the plaguelands, rather than re-plaguing them, then report to Field Agent Kaartish at the Menders' Stead to the east.",
