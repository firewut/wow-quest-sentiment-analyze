Well, I was trying to expedite things so I started unloading a bit more than I could handle. That's when everything came tumbling down.Before I knew what was going on, I saw that menace, Mad Magglish, go running off with a bottle of 99-year-old port. Chased him all the way to Wailing Caverns. No way I was going in there.Maybe you're brave enough to find him?",
