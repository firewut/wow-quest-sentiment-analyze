While rather bland in taste, the meat of the worms can easily be preserved to last for months. We will need several hundred more pounds to be fully-stocked.While you can find carrion worms all over the Plaguelands, they can be found in particularly high density to the south of the chapel.  And remember: larger worms mean more meat.",
