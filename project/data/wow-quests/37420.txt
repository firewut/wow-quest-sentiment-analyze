Now that the workshop is fully armed and operational, we can start cranking out siege weapons just as soon as we have the resources.The Overcharged Siege Engine is the pinnacle of gnomish  engineering, if I do say so myself. It's more powerful than your average siege engine and you can use it almost anywhere! The only limit is the amount of fuel we're able to pack into the chasis.As soon as you're ready to begin production, just bring us some resources and place a work order!",
