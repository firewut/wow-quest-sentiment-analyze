While we remained loyal to Thorim, they became the Lich King's lapdogs!They call the ones who receive his gift val'kyr.  They fly on feathered wings, like the harpies they are.You will find Valkyrion far to the northwest, beyond the Temple of Storms.  Slay these winged she-wolves, sister.  Slay them and I will reward you with one of my most prized possessions.",
