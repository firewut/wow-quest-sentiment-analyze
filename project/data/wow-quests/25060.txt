We expected there to be a modicum of survivors, perhaps some even suitable for interrogation.What we found was a crew of Bilgewater goblins who have all become insane, delusional, and maniacally violent...to further degrees than is normally observed, rather.In short, they are useless and dangerous. Gnomeregan will be best served by cutting down as many as we can.",
