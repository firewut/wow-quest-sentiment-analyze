A diffractory chromascope should suffice, I think.I already have the mithril casing, which surprisingly, is the hardest part to find.  We simply need two other pieces: a ruby and a sapphire.There's pirates nearby, just to our south, and a bit farther to the east.  Pirates love treasure... why don't you see if you can find some gems for me?",
