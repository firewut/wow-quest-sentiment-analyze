Unfortunately, there are many idiots here at the Forsaken Front. We've already lost a few battalions to organized worgen bear attacks. Yes, it's even more idiotic than it sounds.Directly east of here, heading towards Hillsbrad, you will find worgen druids roaming the woods, masquerading as bears. Kill them and make our southern supply line safe again.",
