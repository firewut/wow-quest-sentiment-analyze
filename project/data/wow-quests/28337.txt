Pathetic little things that can't even toil with their own bodies.They stomp around in their massive metal shredders, carving the forest to splinters. I bet they think they're safe in there, all warm and cozy.Prove them wrong. Blaze north through the camp and destroy as many shredders as you can. Once you've spilled some blood, we're going to take this place apart for good.",
