How about trying your hand at hunting?Back on Draenor, our greatest hunters would hunt a beast that resembled the moongraze stag of this region known as a talbuk.If you think yourself draenei enough, go out into the wilds and kill enough stags to fill your pack with meat.You will find them grazing south of Azure Watch.
