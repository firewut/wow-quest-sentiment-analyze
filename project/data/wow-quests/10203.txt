We did that!  <grin>It's yielding up all sorts of goodies for the X-52 Nether-Rocket, but we're running short on equipment.We had an operation at the Arklon Ruins to the southeast until the Burning Legion moved in.  I need you to take this Ultra Deconsolodation Zapper to the ruins.  Use it to beam our gear back to Lead Sapper Blastfizzle down in the fissure.Junior Technician 3rd Grade <name>, this is your chance for that promotion.  Don't blow it!",
