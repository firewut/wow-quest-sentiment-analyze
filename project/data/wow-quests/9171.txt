But I get here and there is no food.  You must go out, <class>, and bring back fresh kills so that I have something to prepare.Dame Auriferous prefers a crunchy texture to her food.  There are plenty of spindleweb lurkers to the southwest on the other side of the Dead Scar.  Disgusting, I know, but that's what we have to work with.",
