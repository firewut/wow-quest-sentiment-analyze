The world hangs by a thread, and all that the Titans have wrought may be in jeopardy.It saddens me greatly, but my judgment is final. Deathwing - the horrific creature that was once the Earth Warder and once my friend - must be destroyed.I have prepared a site atop the Highlands, to the west of the Vermillion Redoubt, where I can bring about his end.
