Before you can go out there and knock some sense into these peons you need to have your \"piece.\" Each overseer has to gather the materials required to make their own \"piece\" and you'll be no different.I'll need knothide leather and the hardened hide of Tyrantus. You'll find Tyrantus in Eco-Dome Farfield, located in the northern reaches of Netherstorm.",
