Saved my life more than once, you know.But I'm gettin' too old to walk him anymore, and he still needs his exercise. Take Dog for a trip around the shelf for me, would ya?He loves to swim through the hot geysers just southeast of the shallows.He absolutely has to... er... \"leave his mark\" on the dead whale at the far western edge of the shelf.Oh, and he'll want to visit our old shipwreck, too. He likes to reminisce.",
