Moments ago, they portaled some Highbourne mages over here to ask for backup. Details are hazy - some sort of stealth attack on the city?I don't know what to make of it, but Jaina Proudmoore is already on the scene and I suspect they need all the help they can get.Speak to Seamus Goldenkicks over there for a quick portal to Darnassus. Find Jaina!",
