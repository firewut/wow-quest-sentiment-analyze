Here, the spirits of the dishonorable spend eternity in an endless futile battle, always seeking glory but never able to attain it.\r\n\r\nWe should not be here.\r\n\r\nWe must find a way out. I will scout ahead - you should try and release some of these captive spirits here. Perhaps one may have some answers for us.",
