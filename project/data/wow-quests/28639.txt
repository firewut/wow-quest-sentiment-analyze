I'd prefer to eat the strongest creature that I can find.Ursius is the largest bear in Winterspring. He eats first when his pack of shardtooth brings down a chimaera or an owlbear. He claims the most comfortable cave in the shardtooth-held lands. And he has... considerable influence with the shardtooth females.He is my kind of bear.I want to eat him.His cave is near the maulers. Good luck!",
