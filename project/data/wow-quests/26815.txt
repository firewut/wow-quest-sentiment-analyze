The reasons why aren't all that clear, but I'd guess it had something to do with his tendency to administer powerful, behavior-altering drugs to anyone he saw.  Anyhow, the Gurubashi priests and their blood god have been slain, but Zanzil the Outcast remains......as do his powerful, behavior-altering drugs.I need his mixture for my next test.  Check the zombies to the north.",
