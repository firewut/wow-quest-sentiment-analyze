This time I am charged with collecting various beast organs in order to power some type of control rod. I am far too frail to go out hunting beasts - especially yetis!Perhaps if I were to offer you a reward of some kind you would do it? All I need is for you to head west to the yeti caves and kill yetis. Rip their still beating hearts from their chests and bring them back here.",
