The scouts and craftsmen there have been tasked with preparing the gear and rations for our men for the climb into the hills.The captain's famous for his temper, so I want to send someone ahead to check on the preparations. Fort Wildervar is far to the northeast, beyond Skorn, up in the snow-covered areas near the border with Grizzly Hills. Find Gil Grisert there and make sure he is prepared.",
