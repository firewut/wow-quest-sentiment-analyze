Now ghosts attack us from that castle across the river, and undead assassins slay our fishers so as to cut off the village's food supply.We're the last family living this close to the castle, but we daren't retreat: this river is the best route for fishers to bring their hauls in to town. Please, will you take the fight to these undead?",
