Empty.But in this place between worlds, death never goes unnoticed.Stray life essence seeps through from the other side; a feast for the beings who prowl here.Slay the shadow creatures here, and gather from their corpses the fine dust they produce. I will need much of it to perform the rites of the Talon King.",
