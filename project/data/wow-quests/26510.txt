If you are to help us defeat the gnolls and find our people, you must be properly equipped. Unfortunately, we are all out of gnomecorders. Without a gnomecorder, there is no way for us to communicate with you when you are in the field.Our last good gnomecorder was stolen by marauding murlocs last week. You will have to go to Lake Everstill, east of here, and recover it!",
