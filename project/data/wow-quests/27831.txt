Over, and over, and over again.Even as a mother myself, I can only imagine her sorrow.No... I mustn't be weak.  Our work is, after all, for the benefit of future generations of black dragons.  Her sacrifice was necessary.She circles the Ruins of Kargath, northwest of New Kargath, insane with fury.  Please, heroes... put her out of her misery.",
