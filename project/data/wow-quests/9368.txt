While fires are burning throughout Azeroth, it is imperative that ours be the hottest and brightest, to properly pay homage to the season.In fact, I have a task for you, if you don't mind. I've not yet heard if the fires in all capitals are properly burning. Travel there yourself and warm yourself by the fires--make sure they're hot!",
