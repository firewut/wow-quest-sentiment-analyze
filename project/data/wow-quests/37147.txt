We are few, though, and they are many.The arakkoa in the south are both beautiful and deadly. They appear lighter than air, their attacks a deadly dance that flits from opponent to opponent.The winds are on their side, as the four winds lighten the steps of my own allies. Bring me a sample of their winds, if you are able. It will surely aid us.",
