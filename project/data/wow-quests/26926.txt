I have other plans, however...We will wait.  We attack Thassarian and his troops when the time is right.  In the meantime, speak with Rhonda Molver and take a flight to the Bulwark, on the Plaguelands' western border.  High Executor Derrington will give you your next assignment.You will hear from me when you are needed again in Andorhal.",
