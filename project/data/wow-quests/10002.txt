From her body language, she's clearly issuing orders. But why? Whose orders is she conveying?My curiosity got the better of my judgment and I shadowed her when she left the fel orc encampment. She headed north, to Firewing Point. I stopped before reaching the perimeter of the blood elf outpost.Kill her before she leaves the fel orc camp again.\r\n",
