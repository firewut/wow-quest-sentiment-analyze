It'll be a lot for us to carry, and these parts can get dangerous -- and who knows what else the Dark Irons might have in store for us now that Saean is with them.I'll feel a lot better if you helped me watch over things. Miran can offload the powder kegs at camp while you and I protect the cart.",
