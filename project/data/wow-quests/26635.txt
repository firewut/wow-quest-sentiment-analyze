Look at them!  Do you really think I can pick up a cannonball, even underwater?- Two: I have a weak respiratory system.  I start to white out after holding my breath for more than ten seconds.- Three: There are sharks.You gotta help me, <name>!  I've been demoted as far as I can... I don't want to see what comes next!",
