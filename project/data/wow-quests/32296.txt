We have access to a secret sewer entrance, but a door bars us from intercepting the shipment. If we're going to succeed in this raid, we will need a key that only the most trusted of Lei Shen's forces carry.If you get your hands on such a key, bring it to me.You can keep whatever spoils you steal from our raid. I simply want to see that this shipment never makes it to Lei Shen.",
