The Broken tribe of Murkblood attacked our fishing village to the southwest, Sunspring Post, and managed to kill or evict all of the orcs that inhabited the town.While the others feel that the best course of action is to kill indiscriminately, I know that we must destroy their leadership. I do not know who their leader is but I suspect that you will know when you find him.",
