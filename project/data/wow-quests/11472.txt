Help me to repopulate their numbers.The reef bulls can be found at the Twin Shores to the southeast. They crave the tasty reef fish that can be found on the east and west sides of the isles.Take this net and gather enough fish, at least a dozen -- maybe more, to lure a bull across the strait to a reef cow.",
