We brought ample mana crystals, so none of us would be tempted to taste the crystal itself.The crystal did not need our hunger to ruin us. Once in our possession, it warped all but me into wretched beasts.The wretched souls still wander, seeking more lives to chain to this lake. Will you give them mercy... or flee to die on safer ground someday?",
