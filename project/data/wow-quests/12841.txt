Not alive, anyway.Among my people I am known as a Yrkvinn, a practitioner of illusions.  As you can see, the Hyldnir have made me their prisoner.If I had my runes, I could make you go unnoticed among them.  Further inside, patrolling the mines, you'll find an overseer named Syra.  She has my runes.  Retrieve them and we'll talk some more.",
