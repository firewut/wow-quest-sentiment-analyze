Odyn has already smiled upon me, my soul belongs in Valhallas. \r\n\r\nMake no mistake, I am not a prisoner. Before my death Odyn appeared to me in the form of a raven. He praised my battles in life and gave me a quest no vrykul could refuse. The Helerjar arrived... and I let them slay me.\r\n\r\nPrisoner-- nay, I am a liberator, sent by Odyn to free the souls of Valarjar.",
