Using these specially crafted phials, you can collect the water of the moonwells.Take this vessel to the moonwell outside of Starbreeze Village to the east, and fill it with some of its waters, then return to me. Pay heed to the lessons of the moonwells, lest we find ourselves furthering our shortcomings.",
