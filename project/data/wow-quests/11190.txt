Now we have ta make special cannonballs ta shoot out o' the infernal contraptions!I would look kindly on ye if ye would go out and find the balls we've already shot. No doubt with the way these louts shoot they be all o'er the place ta the south and east.<The cannoneer spaces his hands apart to give you an idea of how big the cannonballs are.>That would be faster than us making 'em from scratch fer a certainty.",
