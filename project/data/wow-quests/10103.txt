They're militarizing every old draenei ruin from here to Shattrath.In response, the trolls have established a new outpost in the eastern part of Zangarmarsh, just south of the Dead Mire. Swamprat Post, they're calling it. I'm glad they have a sense of humor about living in a place like that, because I wouldn't relish it.The post's commander has asked me to send anyone I can spare.",
