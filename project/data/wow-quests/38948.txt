Something that inspired me.Unfortunately, I've run into streak of bad luck, and I'm ashamed to say that I no longer have my patterns.The naga sorceresses in the lagoon to the west, however, have expertly-sewn wristwraps. And the nightfallen to the north wear robes that we can use... if you can pry one from their greedy clutches.",
