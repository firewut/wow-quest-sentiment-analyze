My kin have studied druidism at the grove, alongside the night elves, for as long as I can recall. Now I am to believe that the tree holds within it an Alliance weapon of mass destruction?Krom'gar is wrong and I will prove it!I have sent my son, Orthus, to Thal'darah Grove in search of this weapon.
