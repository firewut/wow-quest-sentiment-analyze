I left the administration of the town in the hands of Custodian Dieworth, but when Kael'thas and his forces sealed me in the Violet Tower, I lost contact with the custodian.Search for him in Kirin'Var Village and help him in any way you can, <name>. I'm certain he's got his hands full in the aftermath of the attack.",
