Then it would simply be a matter of destroying the thing before its shield goes back up.Brave enough to hazard another trip down there, <name>? I can guarantee a nice reward for you if you can bring down those shields and destroy the crystals.How can you refuse if it means less Scourge, especially ones made from murlocs?",
