The damage spreads further than that, I'm afraid; all that water had to go somewhere, and it went down into the Wetlands.There's a lot of fine dwarves down there trying to help out, and they need supplies. That's why I sent two of my mountaineers ahead with a cask of ale along the path into the Wetlands.I haven't heard back from them since they set off down the road to Dun Algaz. Would you mind checking up on them?",
