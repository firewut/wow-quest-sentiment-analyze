His bodyguard, Meatpie, is a large, mean ogre, and  isn't likely to let you see the foreman without a fight.The two probably occupy a platform that would let them look out over the entire Venture Company operation at Swindlegrin's Dig.Remember, the dig is on the far side of the Suntouched Pillar to the northeast. Good luck, <name>.",
