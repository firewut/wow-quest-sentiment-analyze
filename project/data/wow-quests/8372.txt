There are, however, more reasons to defend this particular forest than plain love for nature.The forest forms a strategic barrier that makes Ashenvale defendable against a large-scale attack.  Without it, Astranaar would last a day or two before being annexed to the Barrens.Do your part in fighting the Warsong Outriders, <name>!  For the Alliance!",
