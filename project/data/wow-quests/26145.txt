With the Ironforge Reserve called up to the Alliance Front, we're left with a fraction of the defense forces needed to keep these lands safe.  My regiment is assigned to watch over the town here and we cannot leave our post for fear of invasion.But we need some pressure put on those damned troggs lurking in the hills.
