Uncertain as to the vernacular, I told him to fulfill his duty as a member of the Horde and deal with the worgen threat of the area. He grumbled something about 'what the lok'tar was cooking' and headed south to the docks.Ordinarily I wouldn't care about whether or not an orc went missing, but I am genuinely curious about what the lok'tar might be cooking. Find out.",
