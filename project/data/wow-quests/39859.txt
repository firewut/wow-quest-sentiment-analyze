Nagrand again, taking notes on his grand adventures and turning them into timeless literary tales.\r\n\r\nBut my heart is really in the hunt. I want nothing more than to put down the pen, and pick up a rifle!\r\n\r\nHemet promised to teach me how to hunt once I finish his latest novel, but the goats around here ate my first draft!\r\n\r\nI have no hope of becoming a hunter if my manuscript isn't recovered.",
