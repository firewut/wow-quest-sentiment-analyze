While it's pretty fun watching the gnomes run face-first into a hail of iron, my bruisers keep doing it too, and it's absolutely killing my overhead expenses.I'd like you to try and dance through the cannonfire, get on that ship, and kill the taskmaster leading the cannoneers. The rest of the crew is probably a bunch of spineless prats; once he's down, we should be good.",
