In some camps, that's the best you can hope for.Not in my camp, though.I prefer to make a paste from whatever soothing herbs I can find, and layer that between bandages. The most soothing herbs I've been able to find in the field are the Mao-Willows from the fields in the northeast. If you run into any, bring them back.",
