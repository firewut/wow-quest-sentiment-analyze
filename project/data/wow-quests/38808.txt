    "description": "The afterlife leaves the dead hungry for the delicacies of their former lives. For the vrykul kings, none such offering is prized more than Bjornharta - a celebratory feast of an engorged bear heart. \r\n\r\nThe bears of the Runewood eat well, and have long been prized for their tender meat. Hunt them and find a suitable heart of offer to the ancient rulers. They will not be able to resist such an offering.",
