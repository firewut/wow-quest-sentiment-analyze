I have a quandary that you might be able to solve.Our agents situated behind Sunhawk lines have reported seeing Sunhawk soldiers parsing an unusual document.Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in acquiring a copy of the document for ourselves. I need you to go out in the field and try to recover the document. I am certain that if you apply enough pressure, a Sunhawk agent will turn over the information we seek. I leave the use of force to your discretion.",
