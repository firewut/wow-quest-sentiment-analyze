If we eradicate them and take Dire Maul for the Horde, we will possess a heavily fortified seat of power in this region with numerous artifacts to sweeten the deal. I sent in a small army of Stonemaul Ogres inside earlier - if any have survived, speak with them and finish the job.That's an order, <class>.",
