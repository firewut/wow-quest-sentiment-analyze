You will need to play on the creatures' emotions if you wish to draw them from their hiding places in the jungle.Cranes abound on both the Cradle of Chi-ji and the Narsong Spires, both of which can be found east of here. Pluck those cranes' quills, then place them in a visible spot near the Crane Temple. Your quarry will come running to you.",
