They infect and corrupt green dragons with the blood of their foul god, and then harvest the evil that has grown within them. They are being farmed like livestock...This disgusting savagery cannot continue. Return to where you left the Hall of Masks and take the other corridor towards the Butchery. Gomora the Bloodletter harvests corpses for these foul and evil rituals there. Take his undeserved life from him!",
