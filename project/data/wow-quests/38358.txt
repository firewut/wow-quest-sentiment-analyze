Naturally, we had some volatile... \"byproducts\" onboard.Regrettably, one such substance was released during our skirmish with the Alliance gunship. As you can see, it is taking quite a toll on the coast.The R.A.S. must remedy this situation before we press further inland.Please take a containment unit and fill it with waste - for us to dispose of properly at a later time, of course.",
