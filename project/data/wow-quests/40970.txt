I worry that he may have found a very dangerous item.\r\n\r\nIt is called the Astromancer's Keystone. It is used to manipulate the stronghold's defenses.\r\n\r\nSuch magic was meant to protect the Moon Guard- used for any other purpose and it becomes unspeakably destructive.\r\n\r\nRetrieve the Keystone. Slay Conjurer Thalerian to get it, if you must.",
