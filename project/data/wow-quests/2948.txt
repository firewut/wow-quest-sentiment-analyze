I am a lot more skilled now, and for the mere fee of thirty silver coins I'll spruce it up for you!  Well, a little more than thirty, actually...I'm in a tight spot right now; all my material stock is all dried up.  If you bring me a bar of silver and a moss agate, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will give it a little more pizzazz!Trust me!",
