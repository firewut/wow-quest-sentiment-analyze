    "description": "During the fighting, of all things, I saw a blue drake swoop in and attack the demons. I couldn't believe my eyes. I'd heard that the Blue Dragonflight had gone extinct.\r\n\r\nThe Legion managed to bring the drake down, but not until after she'd killed a score of them. She was magnificent. Last I saw, they were dragging her in the direction of the southern camp.\r\n\r\nWe should see if she's still alive. A dragon could prove a powerful ally.",
