A huge monster latched on, with giant teeth and icicles hanging from its fins!Would've pulled me into those icy waters if I hadn't cut the line! I can't use the new bait until ol' Frostfin's been dealt with. Use this bait near the sunken boat in the middle of the lake. He won't be able to resist!",
