My cousin Screed Luckheed promised me I would make a fortune, but instead he flew off in his zeppelin and left me here to try to scrape a living out of this mine.  How am I suppose to make a living here with helboars and demons and fel orcs attacking all the time?  My shredder here was broken yesterday and the parts I need to fix it were stolen by fel orcs.  They took the parts into the fissure to the southwest and may have dropped them there.",
