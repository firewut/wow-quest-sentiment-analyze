I have one more task for you while we wait... a favor to grant you, really, should you recognize it.The great wildlife spirits roam around us waiting and hoping for someone that will aid in stopping the destruction. They are with us as we speak even now, and with the materials  you brought me, I can grant you sight. Speak to these spirits, choose one, and return to me with their blessing.",
