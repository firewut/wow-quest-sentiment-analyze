To make matters worse, he's surrounded himself with a network of sentry-bots that will detect any possible attackers.If we're to take on Crushcog, we'll need to take out those sentries. This device launches a dark, sticky paint that will coat the optical sensors of Crushcog's sentry-bots. Use it to take out his early warning system.",
