The Kvaldir have surely taken it with them as they retreated to shallower waters.Speak to the caste leaders to secure a war party, and then lead them in retrieving the artifact from Biel'aran Ridge to the east.I trust you my Battlemaiden, for you have never failed in any task that I have given you.
