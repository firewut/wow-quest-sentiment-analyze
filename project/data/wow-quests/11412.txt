You gotta get us that brew!I'll put you on one of my racing rams and you follow the road to Bladefist Bay.Once you get near him he'll toss you a keg, then you run the keg back here and toss the keg to my more capable assistant.  For now, all we want are 3 kegs.  Do a good job and maybe we'll have another job for you.",
