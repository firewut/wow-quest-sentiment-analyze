The self proclaimed \"Lord of Rhinos\" hunts the wastes for the injured or young - rhinos unable to defend themselves against his cowardly attacks. To add insult to injury, Nedar has raised a rhino of his own to become his mount and bodyguard.It is a rare thing that D.E.H.T.A. would ever call for the death of an animal, but Nedar's tainted rhino must be disposed of... Kill them both and return to me. ",
