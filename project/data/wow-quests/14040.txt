It's another traditional local dish, since it uses ripe Tirisfal pumpkins that only grow around here.If you don't know how to make pumpkin pie already, there's a recipe in your bountiful cookbook.Would you mind cooking up a few slices and bringing them to Francis Eaton outside Orgrimmar? He's bound to be running low by now.",
