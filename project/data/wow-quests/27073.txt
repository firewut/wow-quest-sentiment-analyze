Never has such a den of inequity and sin existed in our great empire. Those damnable goblins fueled our every vice and set us off to sail with barrels full of ale. <hic!>The shame of it all leaves a mark greater than any scar. Honor must be restored! Kill the Bloodfang worgen that ambushed us. They're scavenging the wreckage to the southwest.",
