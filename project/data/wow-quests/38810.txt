    "description": "So an outsider would seek to be judged by the ancient rulers of the vrykul? Curious, this. Know that they will not take to your presence kindly, stranger.\r\n\r\nIf you are so hasty to meet judgment, you can call them forth with a ritual of wakening. To complete this ritual, you will require an aromatic to burn and an offering to present.\r\n\r\nA plant grows in the Runewood that will make a suitable incense. Gather it, and I will instruct you further.",
