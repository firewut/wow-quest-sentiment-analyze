That includes chasin' off predators, whether they be from the forest or from the Horde.I won't ask you to save us from two-legged monsters just yet. Mangy silvermane prowl the woods to the south where our gryphons range, and they're known to get 'em if they stray too low. Hunt a few of the silvermane and make sure they know our gryphons aren't food.",
