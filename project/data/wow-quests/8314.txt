They are apparently a means for the Qiraji and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the silithid.Unfortunately, that is all we could get out of the glyphs. We need to find a way to unlock the messages hidden within the crystals.Take the glyphed crystal prism to Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold.  She might be able to help.",
