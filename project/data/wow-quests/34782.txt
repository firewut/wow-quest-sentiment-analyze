I would like to introduce you to the Exarch Council, \"The Hand of the Prophet.\" I have been trying to convince the Exarchs to support our cause and go on the offensive against the Iron Horde, but they are - as always - too cautious and slow to act.Come with me, I will introduce you to Exarch Othaar up the hill.
