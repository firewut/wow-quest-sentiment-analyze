Unfortunately, since the massacre at Angrathar, it has become almost impossible to get bone from Dragonblight.However, the Forest of Shadows on the western edge of Wintergrasp has enough bones to tide us over.Head to the Forest of Shadows and bring back any bone splinters you can find!The Horde have been seen collecting bone splinters in the area. Slay them!",
