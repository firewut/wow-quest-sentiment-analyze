I've spoken several times with the dwarves of the Thorium Brotherhood, and they've never been anything but helpful.An acquaintance of mine, Jack Rockleg, came to town not long ago, asking if I could join him on an expedition of some sort.  It sounded important.I'm a little busy, but maybe you wouldn't mind going?  Just travel west, on the road to Searing Gorge.  You'll see him soon after leaving the Badlands.",
