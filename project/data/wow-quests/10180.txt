Instead, he's decided to venture out to Auchindoun again on his own.He was lucky enough to escape the Sethekk Halls once, but if they discover him, there won't be a second time.I admire his desire to free his sister, but he's not going to be able to do it without help.Find Isfar and have a word with him, <name>. If you can't persuade him to come back, perhaps you could help him rescue Lakka?",
