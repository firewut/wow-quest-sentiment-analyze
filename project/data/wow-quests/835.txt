There's one thing you need to know in life, and that's if you want something done well, do it yourself.\"I can't deal with losing all our caravans, so I'm just going to take matters into my own hands. Harpies plague our supply routes.  If we kill the harpies, the caravans are safe.Of course, there was one other thing that Gazlowe taught me, and that's \"You can get anything done for a price.\" You in, <name>?  Good... I recommend starting in the canyon to the east.",
