Still, he's gone and the Fangs are with him.We're going to have to track him down for you to recover the Fangs. I should come with you but I have to stay with my people should we be attacked again.Here, my companion Ebonfang has a sense of smell like no other. He will be able to guide you to wherever Verstok is hiding. Also take this shell, through it we can communicate.May Elune guide you.",
