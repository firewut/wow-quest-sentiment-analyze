    "description": "There is little in this swamp that will burn, <race>, so we must resort to other means for lighting Telredor. Many of the creatures and plants in the marsh emit a soft glow.It's difficult and cruel to confine the glowing creatures, so we've turned to a species of mushroom for our light source.We pick and cultivate the fulgor mushroom here, but our needs require us to gather new crops occasionally. The small green mushrooms often grow at the base of larger ones near Telredor.",
