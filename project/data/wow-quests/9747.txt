But even more terrible are the traitor tribes of Broken and Lost Ones that helped them!The worst of all are the Lost Ones of the Umbrafen tribe; they use dark magic to trap and enslave others. They're especially cruel to escaped slaves and would slit my throat if I left the refuge even for a day.Travel to Umbrafen Village south of here and kill them and their leader, Kataru.  Until then I will fear for my life every single day.",
