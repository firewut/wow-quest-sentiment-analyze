I am Ruul, warrior and teacher.You have obviously reached an age when you must prepare for your trials if you are to adventure much further out of Mulgore.If you wish a test of your strength, start by seeking out the Windfury harpies to the southeast. They nestle along the mountain's edges away from the road.They are one of our natural enemies here in Mulgore and will be a good gauge of your skill.",
