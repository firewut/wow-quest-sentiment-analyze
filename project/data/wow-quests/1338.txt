I need a new shield, and I must have one of his!The problem is... Furen is far to the south, in the dwarven district within Stormwind.  In human lands!  I can't imagine why he would live there, so far from Ironforge.  The humans must pay him a king's ransom to keep him there!So, if you want to travel and don't mind making some money, then will you send Furen my request for a shield?",
