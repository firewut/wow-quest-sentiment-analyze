We'll have to see how you handle yerself in the air.The arakkoa are breeding a gargantuan variety of their attack pets and are using it against our scouts.  I want you to take these blasting charges and use them to destroy hatcheries above the arakkoa's dwellings.  Avoid the monstrous kaliri guarding the hatcheries.
