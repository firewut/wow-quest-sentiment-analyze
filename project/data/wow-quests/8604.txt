Unfortunately, out in the field, our soldiers cannot afford to rely upon the presence of a healer to keep them alive. Trust me, I know first hand. Thus, we're putting together all of these first aid kits for them.If you have the time, I need many wool bandages. Return them to me here and I will see to it that you are properly rewarded.",
