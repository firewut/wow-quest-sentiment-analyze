However, the medicine men at the Pools of Jin'Alai are performing rituals that are interfering with my attempts.It is imperative that we break through their obtrusion. If you were to head southwest into the pools area, I am certain that you would come across the cauldrons they are using for their magic.Disturb each of the cauldrons to bring down their ritual that is blocking me.",
