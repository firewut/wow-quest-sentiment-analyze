Mysterious tales of a meandering mountain pathway that completely bypasses Redridge and poops you right out into Bogpaddle!If you run out of things to do, I suppose you'll have to leave.  And we'll all be sad.  When you do leave, talk to Sharon Boomgetter in the southeastern corner of the Steppes.  She'll give you a ride.<Oralius tilts his head, as if listening to something.>Winky?  WINKY!  NO!",
