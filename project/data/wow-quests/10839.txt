It is rumored that the colony of Skettis has constructed a maligned altar of worship. This Darkstone of Terokk must be purified if the arakkoa of Skith are ever to be redeemed.Take this Rod of Purification and cast it upon the Darkstone. Blessed by A'dal, the rod's purity might be enough to bring clarity to the Darkstone. Go now and may the light shine upon thee.",
