    "description": "Speaking of lakes, there's a lake with real good fishin' up to the northeast. I used to go up there with my friends, but my mom won't let me go anymore.She says it's too dangerous, but I haven't seen anything up there but a few little spiders. Like spiders can do anything to you...My favorites were always the eels that live up there. If you're going to be up by the lake, would you think about bringing back some of the eels? They're feisty but once you subdue 'em, you can bring 'em back no problem.",
