It disturbs me to see the power of the elements used by them to harm my tribe and other innocents.We will turn their totems against them! Take my own totem with you into Winterfall Village. Use its powers on the Winterfall's totems from afar, and the fury of the earth will be unleashed on all nearby!Needless to say... keep a safe distance!",
