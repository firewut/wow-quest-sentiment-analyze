He is rumored to have been created by the Old God himself as a mockery of life.His skin is unnatural... thick, nearly impregnable, yet it's flexible and allows him to move with the speed and grace of a much smaller creature.Bring me a sample of his skin along with other minor components and I shall craft you leggings of great power.",
