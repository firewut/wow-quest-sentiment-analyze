Such an assistant must be prepared...I am ashamed to admit that my prayer beads were lost in Honor Hold's courtyard.  I believe the dog Fei Fei stole them and buried them, but I do not know where.  If you speak with his master, Warrant Officer Tracy Proudwell, perhaps she will know where Fei Fei hides his stolen treasures.",
