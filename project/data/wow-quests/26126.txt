Constructing the perfect fuel is a tricky job, as there's plenty of factors to balance: chrono-pyroxidation parameters, tempero-incendiary variables, conflagrational siltification criteria... and that's only naming a few.Hopefully the samples you brought me can be combined in the right proportions to create... the perfect bio-fuel.  Use that table over there and try combining some samples!  Bring the result to me when you're done.",
