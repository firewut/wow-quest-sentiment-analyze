They were there when I was showing them off to my good friend Curver last evening.  We were drinking moonshine and I blacked out - when I woke up the gems were gone!  They must have been darn good thieves, because Curver didn't see anything.Her ship is coming in tonight, and I really need three nightstones to get her present done.  Help me out here!",
