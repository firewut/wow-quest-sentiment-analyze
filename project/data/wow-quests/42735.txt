    "description": "I did some recon in Stormheim. What I discovered is that the Tideskorn are a tribe of vrykul who have been cut-off from the sea by their kvaldir brethren. Many of the Tideskorn have pledged their services to the Legion and become Felskorn.\r\n\r\nMalace Shade was last seen heading toward the Felskorn Warcamp. It is likely that she was captured.\r\n\r\nI have arranged a flight to Stormheim for you. When you are ready, you can use the gateway to travel to Dalaran and speak with Aludane Whitecloud at Krasus' Landing.",
