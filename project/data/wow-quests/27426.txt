If they're the ones who put the torch to the Shady Rest Inn, they'll have had orders from one of their clan elders.There's a large Grimtotem settlement called Blackhoof Village to the northwest. They've been using it as a base to attack the tower, but I'll bet that you'll find the orders you're looking for there. Check the village's elders for traces of the orders you seek.",
