They're never quite strong enough to threaten Kharanos directly, yet they prey on travelers, mountaineer patrols, and supply convoys.I'm going to be withdrawing my observers from the Grizzled Den because I need them on the troll front. Would you help my men finish culling the wendigo population? Without strength of numbers, they won't be able to attack us.",
