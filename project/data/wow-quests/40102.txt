Murky and his followers need a place to hide out and train--away from the mature murlocs--so that they can prepare to take over in the future.\r\n\r\nThere's a nice cave not too far away... only problem is that it's filled with makrura.\r\n\r\nThis would be a good base for the tadpoles. Murky must go show them what for!\r\n\r\nMindmeld with Murky in his egg and show him how it's done!",
