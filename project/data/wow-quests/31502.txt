    "description": "The young fliers of this era are fascinating. Their exceptional agility and endurance were, in my time, the feats of incredibly skilled or mature fliers.This would seem to indicate some kind of evolution in wing structure... Or perhaps a result of advancements in training? Induced genetic mutation? Selective breeding?Gah! There's no way to know for certain without tissue samples.Bring me their wings! And try not to ruin them in the process, will you? I need them intact!",
