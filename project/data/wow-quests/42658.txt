Their arrival has forced many of my fellow druids to flee their homes, but I refuse to go down without a fight.Despite all this, I'm happy to provide enchantments for your weapons, but you should know that it is a delicate process that takes time and concentration, something I have little of lately.If you're willing to shelter me from attackers, I will certainly do my best to enchant your weapons.",
