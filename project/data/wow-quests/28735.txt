I watched as they beat him unconscious and then dragged him to a place the fat one called the \"Chamber of Incineration.\" I think it's just down the hall across the bridge.I'm too scared to go any further. Take my all-purpose diving helm and search for Raz. I'll communicate with you through the helm.And if you find that ogre, kill him!",
