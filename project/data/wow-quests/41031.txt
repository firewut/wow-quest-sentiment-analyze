I have heard the cries of those who have been deprived of sustenance.\r\n\r\nTake this wineskin. Find an Arcwine fountain and take your fill.\r\n\r\nFind those who are suffering and offer them a drink. It is the best we can do in the present circumstances.\r\n\r\nYou must not be seen doing this, <name>. It will end badly.",
