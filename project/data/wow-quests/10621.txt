Sharp-looking runes etched into the metal glow with a menacing light.The weapon's intended purpose isn't clear to you, but it's hard to ignore. Most of the mo'arg at Legion Hold seem to be working with fragments of the same metal you hold in your hand. Perhaps one of the weaponsmiths at Wildhammer Stronghold might be able to tell you more about it.",
