It's not in my style to be underwhelming.To gain access to Socrethar's Seat in the north, we'll need to use his own teleporters - locked by Socrethar's teleportation stone.  The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base Oblivion.  The second half is held by the demon Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna.Obtain these and Voren'thal will be impressed beyond words.",
