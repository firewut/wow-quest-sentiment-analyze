Everyone I knew was slain, including my father Ariut.By tuskarr law I must seek retribution against those who shed my kin's blood.I am but a fisherman and I've not yet passed the test of manhood... I cannot stand toe-to-toe with the vile Kvaldir.If you were to carry out my blood duty for me, I will be in great debt to you.",
