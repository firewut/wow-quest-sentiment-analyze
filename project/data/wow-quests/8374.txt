    "description": "Winning a war is about more than just outsmarting and outfighting your opponent.  Victory often comes down to simply producing more than your enemy.What we have in Arathi Basin is a sizeable supply of resources for whichever side manages to claim it first.If the Alliance comes out victorious, it'll mean more swords and pikes for our troops.
