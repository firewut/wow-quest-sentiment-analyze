They used First Strike to hit us before we even saw it coming.\r\n\r\nLosing ships is a part of naval battles, Commander.  Luckily, we were prepared for this exact sort of situation.  Speak with Yanas down at the dry docks, he should be able to help us quickly produce another Destroyer.  Head back here when the ship is complete, we will have a new mission ready for you.",
