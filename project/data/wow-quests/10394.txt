We have reason to believe that these so-called 'Forge Camps' are where the demons are constructing those blasted Fel Reavers. You can see the closest target, Forge Camp: Mageddon, to the west. Our intelligence suggests that it's still under construction. If you can slay the Gan'arg Servants and their master - Razorsaw - we can bring the Legion's Fel Reaver production to a grinding halt!   \r\n\r\n",
