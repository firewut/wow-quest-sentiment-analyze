They joined others in the mountains, in Tempest's Reach.Everyone left, except the man who kept the journal, old man Bradshaw.  He noticed that the worgen attacks had stopped all of a sudden and decided to venture into the Blackwald.There is an abandoned mill just northeast of town, it was where Bradshaw lived.  See if you can find any clues there.",
