Unfortunately, I noticed that their time out in the wild left them rather gaunt.They must be starving, but I don't feed my prize yaks just any regular old grass.No sir, they eat only the leafiest green cabbages you can find here in the Valley.My stores are a bit low. If you bring me some cabbages for my yaks, I will reward you handsomely.",
