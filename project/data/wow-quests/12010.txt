I didn't see him escape when we withdrew at the beginning of the battle, and I worry he may still be trapped inside the city.If we're going to get an army through Thor Modan, we'll need the information he was collecting. Stoutmantle and his superiors would have my hide if the tunnels collapsed on one of their brigades!",
