While I think our recognition of the legend is the appropriate one, I'm enough of a scholar to appreciate the collection of all information into a single source.When you're done, take the book to Muradin Bronzebeard.  I know for a fact he'd be interested in hearing that others have taken an interest in the older legends.  ",
