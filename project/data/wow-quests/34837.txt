Down south of here there's a mountain that's just full of the stuff but there's one problem; Ogres!The Gordunni live on top of that mountain and they have begun trading the jovite to the Iron Horde.We need to go down there and secure the minerals for ourselves.I'll pack some supplies and meet you near their fortress down south.",
