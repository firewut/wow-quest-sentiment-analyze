(Sorry.) It will take a divine act to empower you further.Fortunately, you've made some powerful allies during your time here. Travel to the Temple of Karabor, where Yrel is waiting for you. With the blessing of a Naaru your ring will become as powerful and unique as - well, as you yourself. Go to Karabor. You've earned it.",
