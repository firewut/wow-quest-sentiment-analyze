I'm certain she'll be pleased to receive this thoughtful gift from Nyoma.When you're ready to travel to Darnassus, just speak to me again and for a few coins, you can hire a hippogryph to take you there. I'm told Sister Aquinne enjoys the solitude of a small plaza just south of the hippogryph master in Darnassus. Look for her there after you arrive.",
