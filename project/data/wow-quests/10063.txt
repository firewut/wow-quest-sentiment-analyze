Would you believe it?They pulled me out of a promising dig and sent me along with Captain Odesyus' expedition to babysit that little gnome!I'd never heard o' a gnome wanting to become a prospector before, so I asked.Seems we are takin' gnomes now, and this particular one has a fascination with murlocs!Well, he's gone off and set up shop in an old turtle shell on the northern shore of the island.
