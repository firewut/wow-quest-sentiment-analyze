The cave has been overrun by ravenous jormungar and the wild bears are all but extinct.If you were to find a surviving matriarch, however, I would guarantee you that she would fight better than any of these bears born in captivity.Take this harness to the Hibernal Cave and rescue a surviving matriarch.  Good luck finding one.",
