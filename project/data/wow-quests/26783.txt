I just heard from a soldier named Nimetz that a <race> <class> up there found the key to what's been driving them so crazy.  That wasn't you, was it?Anyhow, he sent a sample to me, and it looks just like the rocks I've been seeing over at the Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound, to the northeast.I've heard that the ogres are guarding a chest up in some ruins behind their mound.
