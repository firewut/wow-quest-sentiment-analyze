His shop, Limited Immunity, is in the Old Town of Stormwind.Our supply of armor dwindles, and I must contact Osric for more.  Can you take him this note?The fastest way to Stormwind is through Bartlett the Brave, our gryphon master.  He's just outside of the smithy; bring him my note, and then take a gryphon to Stormwind.",
