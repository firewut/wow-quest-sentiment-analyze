Without reinforcements, it's only a matter of time until we will be overrun.Would you lend your skills to the refuge's defense? It would greatly improve the morale of the defenders and give them -- and me -- hope of mounting a counterattack.Kill any of the stormforged or their creations you encounter outside the refuge.",
