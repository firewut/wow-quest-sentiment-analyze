    "description": "I am told that before the great upheaval the Charred Vale was a valley, closed off to the sea. One has merely to look to the south to see that the Charred Vale is no longer a valley and in fact has become an area of great volcanic activity.Salsbury here has configured a device that will allow us to ascend the volcano. Use it to get to the top and assess the goings on.I will keep in touch with this Gnomecorder device, which Salsbury has so kindly gifted upon me.",
