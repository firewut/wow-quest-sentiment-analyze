The Horde, unfortunately, has given us one hell of a fight. Hellscream's armies are mighty and unrelenting. I haven't seen this type of ferocity from the Horde since the second war.Now it would appear that the mine the Explorers' League dug out is being used by the Horde to \"backdoor\" us. We need to seal that thing off!",
