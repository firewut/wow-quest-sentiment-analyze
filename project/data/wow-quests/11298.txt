They attacked our caravan as it passed through the area, and they've harried our foraging parties as well.I must know what's causing this madness! I suspect that whatever they're drinking from the kegs scattered around the gulch contributes to their insanity. I want you to steal the kegs from those dwarves while they're busy mining away.",
