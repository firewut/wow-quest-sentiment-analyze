It was getting late and my armor was weighing heavily on me. I took my gear off and decided to take a stroll. Yes, I, erm, went for a walk. Anyway, when I returned I discovered that my gear had been stolen! It was the yetis. I'm sure of it. They took my pants, sword and helm and ran off into their cave. Get them back for me and I will reward you.",
