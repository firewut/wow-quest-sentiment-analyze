I recently sent my best rogue, Plunderbeard, in search of answers, but have yet to hear back from him. If I were a betting man I'd wager that he's a goner.I want you to go down those steps and head straight through the embalming chamber and look for Plunderbeard. Dead or alive, he'll have answers.\r\n",
