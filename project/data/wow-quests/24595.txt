You cannot understand what it means to my people that Quel'Delar has been recovered.As promised, I will admit you to the Sunwell and you will find the leaders of Silvermoon within. Carry the sword to the chamber of the Sunwell and immerse it. Once the blade is restored, return with it to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest.",
