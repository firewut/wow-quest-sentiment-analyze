Frankly, I don't care. \r\n\r\nYou've proven yourself, so we've decided to give this mission to you.\r\n\r\nWhat's going to happen is this - you're going to go, find them, and kill them.\r\n\r\nOur scouts reported the first group landed to the north, between here and Deadtalker's Plateau. Go there and wipe them out.",
