Most trolls know that the Horde can easily crush them when angered, and the trolls here in Stranglethorn are no exception.The Bloodscalp have been more active lately, however.  As lately as last week, they sent a party into Grom'gol and stole several cases of rations.Stealing food is the most forgivable type of theft, but I still can't let it happen under my watch.  Head north, to the Bal'lal ruins, and return our property.",
