I'm in need of a rare mushroom called drycap.Our foremost orders are to keep our location secret and not risk being spotted while looking for it, or I would go myself.  The only place in Hellfire Peninsula where drycap grows is a cave at the Great Fissure, south of here.Be extremely careful if you choose to seek it.",
