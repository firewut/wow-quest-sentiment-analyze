I can't think of anything better to bring the meal together.There's a good recipe for it in your bountiful cookbook. Why not hunt some wild turkeys and prepare a few? The turkeys wander all over Tirisfal Glades, so you shouldn't have a problem finding any.Once you're done roasting them, will you bring them to Francis Eaton outside Orgrimmar?",
