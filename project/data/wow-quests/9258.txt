The protective runestones along the border with the Ghostlands have warded the land against this taint in the past.The westernmost runestone was destroyed during a Scourge attack, which forced us to burn the ground around it to prevent the taint from spreading.My sister, Larianna Riverwind, watches over the Scorched Grove.  Go find her; she might have some work for you.",
