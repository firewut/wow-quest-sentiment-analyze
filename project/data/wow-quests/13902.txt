We might have stopped the landmass from shattering, but our enemies still have a strong presence in the area.I want you to contact a group of druids at the Grove of the Ancients, far to the south.  They are led by an old friend of mine, Balren of the Claw.Tell them that the time has come to take the battle to our foes.  I will come to aid them as soon as we stabilize the area.",
