An' by the way he was throwing down blasts of ice at his kin to keep them in line, he must be close to figurin' out how to use all of its powers.Boulderfist Hall's south of here an' then east of Thandol Span. Find the ogre an' get back that wand.While you're gone, I'll figure out what we're gonna do about Stromgarde.",
