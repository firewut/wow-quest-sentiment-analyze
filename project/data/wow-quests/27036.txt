Daryl does have some skill, it pains me to say.A year ago, a large bear had been the target of the Farstrider Lodge, but none of the hunters had any luck with him. So, Daryl thought he'd try his hand against him. All he had to show for his effort was that ugly scar over his eye.Kill the bear, and I'm sure even Daryl would be speechless for once.The bear, Ol' Sooty, can be found around his lair in the cave to the north.",
