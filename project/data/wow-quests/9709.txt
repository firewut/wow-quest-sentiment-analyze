I want you to head north again, this time into the heart of ogre territory!Northwest of the Hewn Bog there is a place named Ango'rosh Stronghold, which sits on a floating island across a large mushroom bridge.The ogres must be storing the harvested mushrooms there.  I bet you'll find them all over the place, and probably on the ogres themselves, too!Bring me a sufficient number and I will try to do something about providing the bog lords with a new source of nourishment.",
