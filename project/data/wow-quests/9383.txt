Rather, they are slaves to it and will suffer nothing to stand between them and their addiction. They consume the energies of Outland's voidwalkers to power their demonic magics.I've prepared a crystal charged with a spell that will allow us to neutralize a voidwalker and sever its link to this world when destroyed. I've mostly seen the voidwalkers in the Warp Fields to the southeast of Hellfire Citadel.",
