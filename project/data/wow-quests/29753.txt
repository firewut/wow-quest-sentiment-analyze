It seems the spiritclaws have resorted to poaching in an effort to fuel their simulacra.This complicates our task, for I cannot take the beasts with me through the bridge.Take the bottles west to Tideview Thicket and smash them to return the spirits to nature. Some may be blind with rage and will need to be subdued.",
