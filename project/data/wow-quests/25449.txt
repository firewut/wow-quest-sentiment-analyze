    "description": "My philosophy on leatherworking is that the work must be the best quality possible - no compromises. Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter is trying to sell you ocean-front property in Dun Morogh!In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have run across thick yeti hides. The Yeti are native to Feralas, with many found in Rage Scar Hold to the northeast. I want some, and I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that sounds fair, then we're in business.",
