They are more durable and a better canvas--if you will--for adding the designs and accents that make Drizzlik's Excelsior line.It's hard to find that perfect skin though, the only one that fits my plan is the skin of an elder snapjaw crocolisk.  Find them to the south, near the border with the cape.",
