    "description": "Whatever has happened in Southern Barrens is causing some of the quilboar tribes to flee our direction. The displaced Razormane in particular grow desperate, and their attacks grow bolder. I've lost two caravans this week alone!Our warriors at the Crossroads desperately need those supplies, and I'm not about to let the quilboar grow fat off of their misdeeds. Find the missing supply crates and bring them to me. I'd search the quilboar hovel south of here, along the river.",
