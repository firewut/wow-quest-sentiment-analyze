Azshara herself blessed his trident so it would slay the beast should it ever escape.Now you wield it, <race>.  As much as it disgusts me, I will have my revenge on these barbaric giant-men.Take the trident to the depths beneath Riplash.  You will find Leviroth below an iceberg closest to northern Riplash.Drive the trident into his flesh and slay him!  Return to whomever sent you when you're done; I wish to see no more of you.",
