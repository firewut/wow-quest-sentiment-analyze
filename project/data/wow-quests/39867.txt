I was helpless to this predator's enchanting gaze. It was only when the lion pounced did the stupor break.\r\n\r\nI've told Hemet of this magical beast, but he laughs. I'm not lying, <name>! The lion exists.\r\n\r\nIf you find the beast, bring me a trophy of your kill, and I'll reward you handsomely.",
