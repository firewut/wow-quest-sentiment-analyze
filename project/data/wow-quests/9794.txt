Normally, I would do this myself, but my hands are already beyond full.I have an associate named Kialon at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains to the north. He's expecting to hear from me in the near future, although I suspect he won't like what I have to say.If you would deliver my response to him, you would have my gratitude. I must insist, and this is very important, that you not attempt to read the letter. It is for Kialon's eyes alone.",
