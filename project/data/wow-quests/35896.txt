And your past was revealed to me as well.\r\n\r\nSomeone has woven our fates together. My people are yours to protect, and your enemies are mine to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe Shattered Hand are rallied in Bladefist Hold. Left to their own, they would claim this land for the Iron Horde.\r\n\r\nTake my power, and together we shall break them.",
