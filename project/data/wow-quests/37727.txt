    "description": "As you must know, I'm a connoisseur of drinks... specifically, arcane-infused spirits. Cocktail mixing is alchemy, and as everyone knows, alchemy is magic.\r\n\r\nMy latest drink must be more exotic than anything I've conjured before. I already have most of what I need. But there are a couple of items left on the list.\r\n\r\nNotice the herons down in the lagoon? As with many of the creatures on Azsuna, the magic coursing through the island permeates them.\r\n\r\nTheir eggs will do nicely.",
