There are grapple points above so that we can move up the cliff. \r\n\r\nWe've also setup hay bales to hide in along the likely routes to SI:7. We just need to stealth in and kill Detheroc.\r\n\r\nOnce we get up there, we'll separate to increase the chances of at least one of us making it through the city.\r\n\r\nGood luck, <name>.",
