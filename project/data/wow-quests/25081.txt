The fighting continues, even as the land breaks open under our feet.Someone's got to break the stalemate! I need you to venture into the Battlescar and help my men crush the Horde opposition there.In the center of the scar you will find a flag marker designating who controls the area. Scout out the flag. It'll be worth your while to claim the scar for the Alliance if someone hasn't already done so.",
