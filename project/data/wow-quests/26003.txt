Perhaps we can turn the tables on them, eh?When I was marooned on the Lost Isles a goblin gave me these infrared heat focals. They allow the wearer to see heat signatures of certain creatures. Take the focals and use them while in the woods to the south. They will allow you to easily spot the scouts. Kill as many of them as you can! For the Horde!",
