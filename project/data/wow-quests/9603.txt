It's easy to take simple things for granted, like a fully furnished and stocked inn, until you're forced to build one from nothing.We've managed to salvage this pod for a building, but without the proper furnishings and first aid supplies, the inn is little more than a glorified tent. Nurguni at the Exodar has offered to put together a package to help with our most immediate needs, but I need someone to deliver this list to him.",
