He sees them too. Boy does he get angry about it!It's kind of funny. I see ghosts and people just smile and pat me on the head, trying to placate me. Ramdor sees ghosts and people label him as crazy. I sure hope I never grow up!You should probably talk to Ramdor before you go inside. He was once a death priest.",
