BUT before I let you loose in the world, you'll need to show me that you can handle these fine creatures.So here's the deal:  I'll lend you some racing reins and the use of a ram. You need to prove to me that you can handle using these rams.Keep the ram at a trot, canter and gallop for 8 seconds each.  If you need instructions how to handle the ram, talk to my apprentice, Pol Amberstill.",
