He's a mite strange these days.Not long ago, when returning yet again to our local Spirit Healer, Anara, I couldn't help but notice that her and Azuregos seemed to be hitting it off. I imagine he's still keeping her company.The portal behind me is probably the quickest way to reach her. It might sting a little though.",
