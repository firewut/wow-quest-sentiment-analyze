He must've caught wind of Illidan's descent into insanity and switched paymasters accordingly.If the Scryers get definite proof of this, it will give them a considerable political advantage.  I know for a fact that the Legion forces at this manaforge have orders that bear Kael's seal.Get these orders and bring them to Thalodien.",
