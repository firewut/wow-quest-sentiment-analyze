    "description": "A friend of mine, Sister Aquinne, is training to be a priestess of the moon in Darnassus.  She left Dolanaar to study in the temple last year. Her letters say she is doing well and learning much, but she misses home and her old friends. I've put together a book of her favorite recipes from Dolanaar.If you have time, would you take them to her in Darnassus? You can rent a hippogryph from Fidelio. He's in the center of town, just across from the inn.",
