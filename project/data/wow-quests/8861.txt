All day you'll find free booze there, and at night they'll put on a firework show!It should be pretty nice... but Booty Bay is also having a party today; I bet it'll be even better!Well anyway, Innkeeper Pala in Thunder Bluff needs a supply of Smokywood Pastures fare to help feed all the party goers.  Can you do me a favor and deliver it?Thanks, <name>!  Innkeeper Pala is in the inn near the bridge to Hunter's Rise.",
