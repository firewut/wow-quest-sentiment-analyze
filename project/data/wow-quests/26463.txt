Teronis left days ago, just before the Horde attacked.He was searching for an item he thought could slow the furbolg attacks on our people--a rod created by a now-dead, evil wizard.Before he left, he mentioned a gem for the rod. Unfortunately, we know that the lake has been invaded by some evil force.Please, <name>, find my friend.\r\n",
