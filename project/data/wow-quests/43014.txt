In the flesh. I didn't think he ever came out of that chamber.\r\n\r\nAnywhoodles, he more than suggested, in that way of his, that we send Garona, Vanessa, and our new merry gang of bandits off to have a little chat with The Wolf at Ravenholdt Manor.\r\n\r\nJust make sure they're nice and civil, or that's the last we'll see of them.",
