The poor little thing had no recollection of who she was or where she came from - truly a lost soul.Soon after, we adopted the little girl and named her Hope - for that is what she represented.She is now a young lady, caring for the destitute and homeless of Westfall. Take my Westfall stew to her at Sentinel Hill, south of here.",
