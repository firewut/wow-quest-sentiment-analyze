Apparently I was wrong.My latest customer tells me that the blood elf uses a mechanical device for his communication with the leaders of Prince Kael'thas's special projects. As I understand it, he acquired it from the Zaxxis rebels in the Netherstorm.My client wishes to obtain the projector. Why don't you pay Pathaleon a visit?
