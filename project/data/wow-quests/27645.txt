Gettin' some of that aggression out of his system mayhaps.I'm thinkin' the best place to go lookin for him is at market row, by the old smithy. He used ta hang out there anyway, but since that place is swarmin' with the most Twilight, he's probably got all the more reason to be callin' it home now.Bring'm back for me. In one piece would be nice.",
