I've made a critical error with the sea dogs and need your help to rectify the situation.You see, I sent them out against the worgen coming from Fenris Isle stone cold sober. They attacked the beasts and promptly got their butts handed to them. Many of them died, but a few still live, barely clinging on to dear life.Take this barrel of ale to the Decrepit Fields, east of here, and force it down the throats of fallen sea dogs.",
