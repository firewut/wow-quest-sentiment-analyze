    "description": "The Adherents have been casting their enemies into the hollow for generations.The pools carry Sethe's dying curse, crippling arakkoa with visions of darkness and intense pain. The mind reels, the body writhes, and the wings wither.Most arakkoa die or go insane. Only the strongest can resist - seek them out and use the Eye of Anzu to help them to their senses.Beware, for the worshippers of Sethe also prey on these survivors to fill their ranks.",
