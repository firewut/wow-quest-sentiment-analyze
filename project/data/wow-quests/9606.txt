If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my hippogryphs to him.That's a good lesson to know: hippogryphs are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote hippogryph master after you've already been there.Since you arrived on one of Zaldaan's hippogryphs, you can also use that route to return to Azure Watch with the caregiver's supplies.",
