    "description": "The battle over Dun Garok was the bloodiest of all the Hillsbrad battles. The dwarves, outnumbered ten-to-one, fought until the bitter end. Every last one of 'em died in defense of that piece of land.Now I hear claims that the place is haunted. Nobody wants to go near it! Unfortunately I have orders to prepare Dun Garok for habitation.Could you do me a favor and go to Dun Garok and search for evidence of a haunting? It's far to the southeast.",
