Unfortunately, the elves know nothing of the fine art of fermentation.I overheard that the Bloodmaul ogres down in the ravine have plenty.  I'm willing to give it a try.Do me a favor?  Head south through the Living Grove and then down the ramp to the east into Bloodmaul Outpost and procure me some?  I hear they have big barrels of it laying around and that their brewmasters carry it around to all the other ogres.",
