They only want the absolute waxiest ears money can buy! \r\n\r\nGuess they think they're lucky or something'.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I need you to go get 'em for me. I don't want to hurt any animals, so you'll need to get 'em from the Alliance over at Lion's Landing.\r\n\r\nHave fun - and remember, only bring me the waxiest!",
