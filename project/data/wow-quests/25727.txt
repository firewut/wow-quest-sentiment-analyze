Muradin may pay lip service to those sooty cretins back in Ironforge, but out here all bets are off.We had a raid against the camp last night, and one raid is too many. Their leader's a stout fellow by the name of Glowerglare, and he's hiding in the cave on the south bank of the river.Bring me Glowerglare's beard as proof he's no longer a threat to us and Ironforge.",
