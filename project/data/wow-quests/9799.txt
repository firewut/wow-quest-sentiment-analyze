With the corruption of the water table from the nearby lake, Botanist Taerix is worried that the lashers will not be able to repopulate themselves once we've cleansed the lake.Go to the Ammen Fields and pick some of the corrupted flowers for me so that I might take a look at them and see what can be done.
