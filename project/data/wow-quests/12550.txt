I haven't seen any evidence of this Shango's existence, but my injuries have kept me from venturing outside the camp.If you fancy yourself something of a tracker, you might be able to find out the truth about Shango. Debaar said she saw some large tracks on her last outing. Go north from the camp toward Bittertide Lake, and search its southern shore for the prints.",
