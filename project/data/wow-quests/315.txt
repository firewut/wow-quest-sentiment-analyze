I just need to find the right recipe...The Frostmane trolls grow a plant, shimmerweed, up on Shimmer Ridge to the northwest.  They use it in their strange, tribal rituals. We haven't found much use for it, but it has a unique taste... and I want to experiment with it in my brews!Obtaining the shimmerweed will be dangerous, but I'll pay well for any you can \"borrow\" from the baskets in the troll village.",
