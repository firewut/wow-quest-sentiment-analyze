I remember vividly how he leapt from the seafoam and plucked poor Poop-Deck Paul from the crow's nest.Swallowed him in one gulp, he did.  And snapped my mizzenmast in two on the way down.No man on my crew deserves such a heinous death.  So we're going to use Negolash's appetite against him.  Kelsey Yance should be able to sell you some meat, and Whiskey Slim has enough booze to knock out... well, a sea giant.  You'll find both of them in town.",
