We initially came here to investigate what techniques and technology could possibly allow a hopeless pack of green-skinned imbeciles to survive such harsh conditions.While the goblins are at a loss, we still need to find out exactly what happened here. Search the beach for wreckage and belongings and bring anything that appears significant back to me.",
