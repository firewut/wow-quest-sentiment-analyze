We could use some more able bodies in Icecrown.The Alliance scum rushed into Icecrown ahead of us, unprepared, and got just what they deserved for their impatience. We took our time, we made ready, and soon we will mount a true assault from one of the most advanced pieces of engineering known to Azeroth - Orgrim's Hammer.
