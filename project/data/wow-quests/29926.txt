The boys call 'em \"nibblers.\"A few days back, we tunneled into a huge nest of these critters. They spilled out into the mines and went crazy, chewed up damn near everything in sight - including some of the boys.You get in there and clear 'em out, and we got plenty of jade to spare. The quarry is directly west of here.",
