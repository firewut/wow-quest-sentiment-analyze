    "description": "I raise creatures born of the earth to help defend myself and my people. When I was captured, I ordered them to stay behind at our home, but they are often disobedient and likely tried to follow me.\r\n\r\nIf they did, I fear the Bloodtotem may have captured them, or worse. In my current state, I can't muster the strength to find them. If you find them, it would be much appreciated.",
