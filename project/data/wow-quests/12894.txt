As of my last correspondence with them, they had successfully established a camp on the border of the Dead Fields, northwest of here.In light of this newfound information about Drakuru and Prince Navarius I think it would be prudent to send someone to the Crusader Forward Camp post-haste.Pack up your belongings, <name>.
