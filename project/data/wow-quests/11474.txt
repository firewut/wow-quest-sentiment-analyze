The cipher they recovered will help us crack the stuff we've found up here - that is if we can ever get back to it! Damned iron dwarves have sprung up like leaks all over the place and are now attemptin' to bury the sites! Can you believe it? Bastards want to bury our finds!Anyhow, talk to Walt over yonder.
