Ahota tells me that he tests his horns at the foot of the frozen waterfall to the northeast of the post. Ahota tells me that our hunters have used the acoustics of frozen water in this way for generations. I can't wait to learn more!Will you help me test out the horn? If I've done everything right, you may even attract a yeti, so be prepared! Bring the horn back once you've tested it. ",
