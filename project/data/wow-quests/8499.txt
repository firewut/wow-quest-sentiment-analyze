In addition to all of the other collection efforts underway, we are in need of a great quantity of thorium bars, which is the task that I am in charge of. The thorium will be used in the creation of many different things for the war, foremost of which is the construction of a battalion of steam tanks to be airlifted into Silithus as soon as they are completed. Can you aid us in this endeavor, <class>?",
