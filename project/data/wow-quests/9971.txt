I've been away for a couple of days on a survey of the Bone Wastes to the south.Please, you must help me to uncover what's behind this horrible tragedy.  Go into the thicket and look for a clue that might reveal something to us.  When I was in there briefly, I could have sworn I saw a dead Broken and a strange object next to him. And don't worry about Treelos - he might have been driven insane by what happened, but I think he's mostly harmless.",
