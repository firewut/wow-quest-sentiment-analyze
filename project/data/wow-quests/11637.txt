The snobold who did this is known as Kaganishu.Though you have vanquished his shaman helpers, my spirit is still tethered to this place. After he slew me, he created a fetish from my body, which anchors me here. Kaganishu is using it to learn all that I know of shamanism.You must retrieve the fetish from him and use it upon my spirit. Kaganishu is nearby in the caves.Only then will I truly be free.",
