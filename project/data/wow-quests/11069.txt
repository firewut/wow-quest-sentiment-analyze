Made to sit in their tower and listen to them endlessly whine about the bridge to Dun Baldar. About how it's \"unfair\" that blah, blah, blah, blah... War isn't fair! To hell with 'em all!The minute I was freed I left that place forever and came here to start a new life. Now Mulv and I are vying for the top orc spot. If you want it, you're gonna have to go through me, scrub.We go when you're ready.\r\n",
