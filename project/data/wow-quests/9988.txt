They may look like a band of fearsome warriors, but underneath all that steel, they're nothing more than a troop of dandies!And they won't be seen in public without their hats. They're extravagant affairs made from felt and fur, complete with the gaudiest feathers you've ever seen.The most desirable feathers come from any of the arakkoa, of course, and my supply is running low. I'll gladly pay you if you'll collect them for me.",
