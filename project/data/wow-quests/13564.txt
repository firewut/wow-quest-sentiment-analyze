I sent him ahead to let the Sentinels know we were coming before we left Auberdine, but he never arrived. I sensed something might be amiss as we were leaving, but with the evacuation, I never had a chance to act on it.If he's injured, there's only one place that he would go - the Withering Thicket, north of Auberdine, down the road to the south from here. Bring him back to me safely... he's my only family.",
