Nothing happens in that Mountain without me knowing about it, <class>.Recently, a different sort of orc came into Blackrock. He resides just inside Blackrock Spire, and I know he's somehow planning to overthrow Nefarian and his whole army of orcs. Normally I wouldn't trust their kind, but we share a common goal for the time being. Find him, he's called Acride.",
