What I've seen in my time here is that Garadar could benefit from a long term Horde liaison.I know that Blood Guard Gulmok needs all the troops he can get, but I know he'll understand that my mission here isn't yet complete. Travel to Shadowmoon Village, in northwestern Shadowmoon Valley, and inform Blood Guard Gulmok of my delayed arrival.",
