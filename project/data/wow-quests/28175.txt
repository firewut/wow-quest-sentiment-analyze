We lost this forest to the black flight, and it has since been corrupted and petrified. Nearly unredeemable.But all is not without hope. I've brought a powerful tool to begin the healing process. The tree may still be saved, with much time and fortune, and with perhaps a little effort from you.Bring this, Alexstrasza's Tear, and use it within the hollowed heart of the tree.",
