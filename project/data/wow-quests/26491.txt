It's been abandoned since then, but it's still prime territory, worth takin' for our allies!Problem is, it's full of dwarf-eating slimes and oozes. Those things are slightly less disgustin' than trolls, but they'll still give us a hassle.With our boys tied up fightin' the Revantusk, I need you to go to Skulk Rock and clear the place out for me.",
