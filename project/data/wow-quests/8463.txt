If not handled properly, the crystals could explode with enough force to blow a hole into the city walls.Now, <name>, I don't quite care if they blow themselves up while tapping unstable arcane sources, but the whole incident would make my men look bad.Bring me back any remaining stolen crystals you find; they might still be inside their original crates.",
