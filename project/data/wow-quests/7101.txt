So to that end, I want you to attack a bunker that is controlled by the enemy.To do that, enter one with an Alliance banner.  You will see another banner inside.  Pull out that banner, and a white Horde banner will appear in its place.  Well done!At that point your task for me will be complete, but if you hold the place long enough, and if the Alliance doesn't take it back, then it will be destroyed!",
