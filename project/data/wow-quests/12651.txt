    "description": "When the trouble with the Venture Company started, I asked Marvin Wobblesprocket and his wife, Tamara, to take their flying machines east to River's Heart. I asked them to setup a small camp there so that we could use them as a relay to fly in supplies and survey the area.They should have arrived by now and started setting up. River's Heart is near the center of the basin where the rivers converge. Search for Lakeshore Landing on the northeast shore. Marvin mentioned it would be the best spot.",
