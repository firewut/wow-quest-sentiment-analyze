Not only are we plumb out of fish, but there's acres of dead threshadons out there left to rot in the sun. The buzzards are after them, and they're spreading all manner of filth and disease right on the outskirts of town.I can't ask you to clean it all up, but could you deal with the buzzards? Killin' even just a few will help.",
