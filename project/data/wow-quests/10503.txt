Just to the west, down in the ravine, lies the Bladespire clan.  While they aren't the only ogres, they are the closest and they're the ones that we defeated to take this place.Head north through the Jagged Ridge, and then down the path, which leads to their hold.  Slay as many of the Bladespire ogres and their raptors as you can at Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds.",
