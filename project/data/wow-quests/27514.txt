    "description": "While you were fighting along the coast, I spotted a gryphon tumble out of the clouds almost due west of here.It wasn't one of ours.Likely it belonged to one of the Wildhammer. I know that Kurdran wanted to establish contact with the lost Wildhammer clans as one of his primary objectives after taking the beach. I can't spare any more of my men to scout it out, but I can spare you. Find that downed Wildhammer!",
