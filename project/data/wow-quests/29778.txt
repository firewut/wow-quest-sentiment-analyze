The hozen have defiled many of them, and sadly, they are not recoverable. We will deal with the problem directly - burn the defiled scrolls. Wipe the hozen writings away entirely.Do not worry for Elder Shaopai. The people shall come together and help him rewrite the wisdoms in time. I shall see to that.",
