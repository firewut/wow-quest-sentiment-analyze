We're going to need power cells to animate it.When I was in Dun Argol, I noticed that Rune-Smith Durar and Rune-Smith Kathorn were the ones who manufactured the cells. We'll need one from each to power our golem.You should be able to find each rune-smith in his workshop on the central level of Dun Argol.",
