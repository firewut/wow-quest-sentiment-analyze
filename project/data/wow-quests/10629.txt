    "description": "I finally got my shredder working but I seem to have lost the keys.  I keep a pack of felhounds to protect my camp.  They don't do a very good job and they like to bite me a lot.  They also like shiny things.  I think this one felhound I have may have eaten my shredder keys.  I'll pay you if you'll take my felhound on a walk.  Kill some helboars and let him eat.  He'll do his business.  When he's done, see if you can't find the keys in his \"leavings.\"",
