Of course, you should only resort to melee in the most dire of circumstances, but that is no excuse to be unprepared.I can assist you in creating a staff befitting a mage of your learning.  Simply take the phial you retrieved for me and fill it at the base of Elrendar Falls.  Just follow the river southeast from here.",
