They are somewhat like fel cones, but quite a bit more potent. Nature often responds very negatively to demons, and these ireroot seeds prompt a very concentrated form of that reprisal.To our north, in Fel Rock, there are grellkin that are far beyond redemption. Use the ireroot seeds to route them before they become a more serious threat.",
