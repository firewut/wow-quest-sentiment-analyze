To that end, they've been honing their skills against the valiants representing the other Alliance capitals.I suggest you do the same. The valiants practice in the ring just outside our tent. Equip your lance, go to the stables outside the pavilion and mount the stabled Ironforge ram, then challenge other Alliance valiants.\r\n",
