Our scout was sent into the enemy stronghold to clear out some of the guards that patrol the area, and to send off a flare so we could enter with a coordinated attack.  Our ninety-nine remaining men lie at the ready, waiting for that flare.  I need a talented <class> like you to sneak into Tyr's Hand, take out as many of their guards as possible, and then set off that flare.Are you up to it?",
