This is a time of renewal; the land slumbers under a blanket of snow brought forth by Greatfather Winter, who is NOT the bumbling fool over there in the red suit!If you're interested in learning what the Feast is all about for yourself, ask Historian Karnik at the Explorers' League.  I'm sure he'll be surprised that someone cares about history rather than getting presents.",
