Something that's guaranteed to work.The few types of wildlife that managed to make a foothold in the Tainted Forest are, without a doubt, affected by the land's latent energies.  Your task is to collect their body parts and find a way to combine them into a vessel.  If Wormthorn's trance is druidic, or even if it is demonic, a large enough vessel of tainted animal flesh should be able to break it.",
