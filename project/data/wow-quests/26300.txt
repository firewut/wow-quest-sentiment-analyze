But we are no closer to finding him.We must know the truth, and I fear that only the Bloodscalp witchdoctor will know it.  He is an enemy of the Darkspear tribe and will not speak freely, so we must force the truth from his dead lips!Bring me the head of Nezzliok the Dire and place it within this cauldron.He is deep within Zul'Kunda.
