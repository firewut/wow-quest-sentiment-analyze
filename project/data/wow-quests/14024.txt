It's another one of our favorite dishes here in Stormwind, since it uses ripe Elwynn pumpkins that only grow here.If you don't know how to make pumpkin pie already, there's a recipe in your bountiful cookbook.Would you mind cooking up a few slices and bringing them to Edward Winslow outside Ironforge? He's bound to be running low by now.",
