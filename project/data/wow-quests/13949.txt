Too heavy to use on foot, but perfect when riding at the head of a caravan. I call it my 'street sweeper.'We need to get those supplies you've collected to the Crossroads, and I expect trouble. I'd like for you to ride shotgun. Literally! Say the word when you're ready and I'll put you at the head of our next caravan.",
