The trolls indicate that they have at least two captives though... the only other person that comes to mind is Alanndarian Nightsong, a civilian that was in the area against my advisement early yesterday.The Shatterspear have established a war camp to the north - it is almost certainly where any of their prisoners are being taken. Find them and free them if you're able.",
