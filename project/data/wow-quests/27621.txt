Sometimes their buildings crawled right out of the earth in the middle of our villages. It was a nightmare!In the chaos, Firebeard is one of the few who's kept his head on straight. He's trying to piece together a full gryphon wing from the survivors.If you want to bring the Wildhammer into the Alliance, start by helping out Firebeard, to the west.",
