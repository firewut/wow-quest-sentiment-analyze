We'll be supplying Tirion's forces with lumber.My lumberjacks were being exceptionally productive, too... up until the point when the spiders came.  Now they refuse to go any deeper in the woods.Maybe you can help me out.  Hop on one of my horses and use it to frighten those spiders.  Maybe we can avoid bloodshed and just scare them away.",
