All three were promptly dismembered.Our sisters in Valkyrion were not as dedicated to our traditions and accepted the Scourge's advances.  Now instead of capturing their drakes from the wild, they raise them from the blight and filth that the Scourge wallow in.Take the frost oil that the Valkyrion Hyldnir carry on them and use it to freeze any blighted eggs you find.  Rumors speak of a fetid pool of blight where the eggs are kept.",
