Scouts reported seeing it attacked by the Kvaldir, fearsome vrykul raiders who roam the seas.They've slain the crew and taken the cargo to an island called Hrothgar's Landing. If you look to the north, you can see it shrouded in the mist. Would you help us in recovering the stolen supplies? Without those tallstrider legs, we'll soon be out of food.",
