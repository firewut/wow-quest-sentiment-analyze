In Everlook, a gorilla hide fetches ten times what you'll get for it down here!I'm not going to send you all the way up to Winterspring - that'd be irresponsible - but I could use your help actually obtaining some hides.You'll find gorillas at Fungal Rock, to the northeast, near a waterfall.  Don't forget to check inside the cave!",
