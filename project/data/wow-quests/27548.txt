Our troops occupying the town were decimated, of course, but what made the attack especially interesting was the racial composition of the attacking force. No humans were used.<Walden laughs.>Rightfully, they fear being reanimated as Forsaken.Let us teach the non-humans a lesson in fear. Together we will show them what happens to corpses that we cannot use.",
