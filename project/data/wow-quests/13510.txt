I wasn't looking forward to enduring what Alanndarian did, so the rescue is somewhat welcome.I saw the troll leader before I was captured, and thought I had the perfect opportunity to kill him, but he's protected by some sort of magic shield. Morra needs to know before she mounts her assault, but first, we need to get out of here.Help me to the dock - I'll make my way to Lor'danel via water, and you can go back to Morra with the intel.",
