They now migrate here and squat upon the deserted farmhouses and towns of the region.To make matters worse, we are now under attack by the gnolls. The Westfall Brigade needs your help, <name>. Slay the attacking gnolls and recover their orders. Someone is pulling their strings and we need to find out whom!",
