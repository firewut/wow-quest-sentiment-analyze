It won't last long, however.I want you to fly a dragonhawk over to the scar and put a dent in the demons' numbers with these arcane charges.If all goes well, they won't even notice us taking the armory from Kael's lackeys.  Talk to Ayren, the dragonhawk master in the west part of the harbor, when you're ready to fly there.",
