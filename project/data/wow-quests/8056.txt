They ain't a witch doctor; they spend their time castin' bones or readin' the leaves for insight - not hexin' people.  As a shaman, you already know somethin' about the power of augury; we Zandalar prize the insight they give to the tribe.Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us.  Do this for us, and I'll give ya some bracers that our augurs prize above all others!  ",
