He has called out for help, and you must go to him.However, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way.But first, you must cleanse your inner turmoil through meditation.There is a shrine that sits at the top of Frostblade Peak, far to the northeast. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain.Meditate there to cleanse yourself and then return to me.",
