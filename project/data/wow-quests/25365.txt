If we were to find those plans, then we'd have a clearer idea of what is making them so worked up.I want you to head back to the Woodpaw and find anything that might resemble their battle plans.  They have to have something; their attacks have been too coordinated to be done without them.  Find them, and return to me when you have them.",
