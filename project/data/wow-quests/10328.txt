Naaru technology is incredibly advanced; it should've taken Kael'thas years to even begin to understand it.Information-gathering on the subject has been difficult as Kael's army is well disciplined and destroys all evidence of written communication.We've been informed Manaforge Duro is under attack by mana creatures.
