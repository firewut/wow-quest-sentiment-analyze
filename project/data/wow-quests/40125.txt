    "description": "You have used the spellstone of Kel'danath to soothe countless withered. Yet it contains merely a shade of the arcan'dor's power, drawn from its slumbering seed. \r\n\r\n<Thalyssra holds aloft a gleaming white branch.>\r\n\r\nThis fell from the tree. Though it is severed, it is not dead - invisible threads of magic bind all pieces of the arcan'dor together.\r\n\r\nI have enchanted this branch with a new iteration of Kel'danath's charm spell. With it, you can mend the arcane essence of even more withered. Use it well.",
