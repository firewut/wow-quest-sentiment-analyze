Once used to aid us in the gardening of Sunstrider Isle, the bestial tenders now have grown out of our control.  Clear them out with due haste, but be warned - their lack of control has made them aggressive.  It is such aggression that forces us to put down these once-gentle servants.It doesn't please me to ask you to do such a task, but survival is survival.  I'll mourn later.",
