We need to rout the black dragonflight from Azshara entirely before they can return with any communication for their master.I still don't know what they have up their sleeve for capturing us, so I'd like to ask this one last thing of you - go into sable ridge and kill their leaders, Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion.If things get hairy, I will come help. I just don't want to risk falling into whatever trap they set for Azuregos.",
