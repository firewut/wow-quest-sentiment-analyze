I have many customers lined up in far off places to purchase it.I could be convinced to let you in on a cut of the profits.The wild elekk roaming Nagrand have the high quality of tusks that I'm after.  Steer clear of the bull elekk; their ivory isn't in the condition that I desire.Oh and don't worry, it's not poaching; I have an understanding with both the orcs and the draenei.Do you and I have an understanding?",
