She pulls the cart that hauls some of the animals in our Zoo Bizarre.She's a hard worker and she tears through shoes like you wouldn't believe. It's about time for a new set. I've already bought the raw materials.All you need to do is shape them over an anvil and apply them to Baby's feet. It's a quick job and worth some tickets, wouldn't you say?",
