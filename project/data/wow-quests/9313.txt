Follow it and cross the Crystalbrook River to arrive on the larger part of the isle.  Continue to follow the path and you should find Azure Watch.See if you can convince them to send us some aid and supplies.  The rest of us will follow when we can.Thank you, we wouldn't have made it without you!",
