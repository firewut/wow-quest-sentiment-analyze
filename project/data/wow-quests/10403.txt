I thought the others were dead, but I've slowly learned that at least two others are alive - chained down and powerless just as I am.I've not yet been able to find Naladu and fear for the worst.  There are more huts in the ruins upstairs; perhaps you could look for him.  It would be a great boon for our tribe if all our elders were alive.",
