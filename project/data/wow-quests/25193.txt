As long as I refused to admit it, I recognize now: Kron is not returning from his crocolisk hunt.I've been working on a project... something that will memorialize Kron's passion for the hunt.  It's a crocolisk-tooth necklace... rows and rows of teeth, suitable to be worn by only the bravest young orc.  I will place it on his grave.Kron was brave, but he was not strong, like you.  Will you bring me the teeth for my necklace?",
