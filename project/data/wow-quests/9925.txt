Because he projected a ten percent increase in productivity by setting up shop here instead of in the mountains to the south.Never mind the crazed voidspawn wandering all of ten feet away from us.  That would be the security officer's problem, not Gezhe's.Kill some voidspawn for me and I'll pay you a tenth of our security budget.  Don't get excited, it's not much of a budget.",
