I spent all night cutting them, but when I stepped out for a bit of breakfast, the little beast came into my workshop and swallowed every gem in sight!  The thing can digest ANYTHING, and trust me, you'd break your back trying to pick up its leavings.I need to get replacement gems fast; the courier is coming in tonight.  Help!",
