North of Stormwind there is a great little spot called Olivia's Pond.The pond is stocked with crystal bass every year but they are hard to catch.  They only bite on a very specific type of bait... overgrown earthworms.  If you search the shore around the pond, you should find plenty of worms to use as bait.",
