You might be tempted to think that we just throw everything into the still and let it sit, but you're wrong.Ingredients and heat need to be added at certain times, and the pressure regulated at others. You'll have no more than 10 seconds to react to a situation. Speak with \"Tipsy\" McManus when you're ready to start distilling.",
