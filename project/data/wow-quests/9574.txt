The Exodar's crash scattered debris all over the islands and I think it's beginning to have an adverse effect on the wildlife.Before I can be certain of my conclusion, I'll need to get a closer look. The crystals seem to have affected the trees the fastest, so it seems that the treants would be the most likely to show symptoms. If you bring me samples of bark from corrupted treants, I can begin my in-depth studies.",
