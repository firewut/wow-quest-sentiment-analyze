Dat is Boden the Imposing, one of Therazane the Stonemother's Stone Lords.We be knowin' little of da Stone Lords, but Boden is not known ta be very level-headed. Sadly, he seems to be da one leadin' dis assault, so he's the one we must be confrontin'.Take dis proclamation to him and read it aloud on behalf of da Earthen Ring.
