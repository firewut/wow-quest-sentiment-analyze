He was babbling about some dark distortions that have begun to appear in the Spirit Fields around Oshu'gun in Nagrand.According to him, these, uh, multiphase... um, spectro-goggles will allow the wearer to see the distortions and take readings from them. He insisted that recording this data was fundamental to our campaign at the Sunwell. I think he's nuts, but I'm under orders to investigate anything that might help. Would you mind taking some readings?",
