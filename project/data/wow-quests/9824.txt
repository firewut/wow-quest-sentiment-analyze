If I could get near an underground water source, my crystal would pick up the signals much more clearly.I've heard of an underground pond as well as a well in a cellar below us.  This whole place is crawling with ghosts however, and venturing there would be hazardous for someone my age.  What do you say; will you help an old man and perform the scrying for me?",
