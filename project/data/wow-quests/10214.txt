I don't know how they can sleep through all the disurbances coming from the mine, but that's the least of my problems.If we don't get rid of those gan'arg pests soon, Thrallmar's supply of ore and other minerals will be cut off. I've already asked Watch Commander Krunk for help, but he says he can't spare the men with the town under constant attack. Will you help?",
