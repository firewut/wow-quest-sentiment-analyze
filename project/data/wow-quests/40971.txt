It is more convenient for them that we are pinned down while they search the Sanctum for my father's relics.\r\n\r\nMy companions and I can escape to higher ground with some help.\r\n\r\nTake this crystal. While standing on a mana focusing rune, use it to overcharge a Conjurer.\r\n\r\nTheir summons will turn on them and create an opening.\r\n\r\nUse it well, and we will meet you atop the stronghold when the way is clear.",
