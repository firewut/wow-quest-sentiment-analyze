Once our brethren, they now live in the Fallow Sanctuary to the west, catching or killing any who wander near.And they have stolen something sacred to us--draenethyst crystals.We lack the force to enter the Fallow Sanctuary and reclaim our stolen draenethyst from among their huts and campfires, but without those crystals... we too may lose our way.",
