It's only right we do what we can to support them.A good beat's what every troll needs to do his best in a fight. The poundin' rhythm of the drums drivin' you to hit harder, callin' the spirits to watch over you. Take my drums to the battlefield wit' ya. Play 'em for our warriors, and let 'em show the Wildhammer who owns these lands!",
