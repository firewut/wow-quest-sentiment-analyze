I cannot speak for the night elves when it comes to all the atrocities those demonic creatures have committed, but I have sworn an oath to the Earthmother to aid the elves in ridding the land of such a nuisance.I am sure you would prove yourself if you aided me in purging them.Northeast of here, you can find the Haldarr clan. Return to me after you've tested yourself against their power.",
