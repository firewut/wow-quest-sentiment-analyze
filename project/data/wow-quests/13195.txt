However, with all of this snow and ice, our soldiers can easily catch cold.Head to the Steppe of Life in southwestern Wintergrasp, and bring me back 10 Horde Herb Pouches. I will grind the herbs into a medicine to protect against the cold.The Horde have been seen collecting them from the plant life in the area. Do not hesitate to slay them and retrieve the herbs!You may also find one on a lasher in the area.",
