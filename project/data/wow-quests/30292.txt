The thing is, they were already against us, so I'm not sure they really thought this thing through fully.Anyway, Anji's the fighter in this pair, I'm more the lover, so I'm looking for someone to do all the weapon swinging and spell flinging and war crying and such.Can you go kill some saurok for me?",
