In time, I also came to notice which spirits I couldn't hear.For all my attempts, I have never been able to make contact with the spirit of an arakkoa ancestor. Their magic is fundamentally different from ours, but I'm not convinced that their spirits are beyond my reach.Bring me feathers from many arakkoa; perhaps having some token from them will provide the link I need.",
