Goldspade's journal seems to indicate that the only place to do this is the location where it was initially dismantled.\r\n\r\nThe journal mentions a \"Spirit Forge\" used to dismantle the blade, and that it may be located somewhere in the nearby gorge. Find the forge and use it to combine the pieces you've gathered.",
