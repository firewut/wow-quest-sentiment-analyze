Without warning, a wave of troggs emerged from the caves near Gnomeregan and overran the Frostmane trolls. The trolls have been migrating east ever since.There has always been a Frostmane presence up on Shimmer Ridge, to the northwest, but with the migration, the trolls now surround us. We can't allow the trolls to use this position to their advantage. While my men hold the line in the east, strike against Shimmer Ridge.",
