    "description": "Herring is one of the most sought-after fish in Darnassus, but not just any herring. The Kaldorei herring is native only to the waters surrounding Teldrassil.I try to keep a good supply of it because it's so versatile! I just finished smoking a batch of it, so I need to rebuild my stocks. Would you mind helping me? You can catch Kaldorei herring by fishing in Rut'theran Village.",
