We'll use plants that grow in the sandy soil of the riverbanks and lake beaches.The sandfern is best for this purpose. It grows in the sandy areas near the shores of the Seabreach Flow, just to the south, Bittertide Lake and Bittertide Falls, to the north, and the edges of River's Heart, the large lake beyond the mangal to the east.",
