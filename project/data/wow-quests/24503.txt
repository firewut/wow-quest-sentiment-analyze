You demolished the Steamwheedle Sharks, so now all that's left to do is to kick the winning goal.Now, just between you and me, I think we should do this one right.

I want you to kick it so far it sails between the two smokestacks behind the goal!I've modified the footbomb to give you the extra power that you'll need.Make me proud!",
