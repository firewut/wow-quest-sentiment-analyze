During the attack I was poisoned, leaving me barely able to stand. I can make an antidote, but it will take time before it is ready.I would ask that you defend me until I can apply the antidote. I will aid you with my bow as best I can.Should we survive, I will be able to deliver my message to Lor'danel, while you speak with Onaeya at Maestra's Post to inform her of this incident.",
