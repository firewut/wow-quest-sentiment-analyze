I'm sending Jorgensen with you to watch your back.Now the prisoners are being held on the northeast side of the valley in a large cage, but the key to the cage is in a cave on the south side of the valley. You'll have to steal the key, create a distraction, and free the citizens.Good luck, <name>! I'll be in touch through the field kit.",
