I was the fool to believe he would fight fairly.Now, my own brothers turned against me, and here I am, speaking to our enemies.I know you have come for Osul blood.I only ask that you hunt down the three who betrayed me.Urang, who poisoned my drink. Ku-Tong, who bent my spear. And Battat, whose dagger slipped into my side as my victory was assured.Do this, and I can die in peace.",
