Some of these mummy trolls, and their living counterparts, carry juju; glowing objects that house an unknown power source.  It's probably what is animating them!The catacombs lie within Sungraze Peak, directly to the east. I am told that the easiest way in lies on the north face of the mountain. See to it, <class>!",
