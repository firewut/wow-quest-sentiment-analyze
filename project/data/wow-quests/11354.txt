I, of course, speak of Vazruden the Herald and his dragon mount, Nazan.If you want the finder's fee that I offer in return, find them flying above the Ramparts at Hellfire Citadel and return with the dragon's riding crop.My sources tell me that the item in question is personally held by the dragon. It is said that Nazan refuses to allow Vazruden to strike him with it.",
