I just managed to find where the trolls are holed up, but I saw so many trolls, I was afraid to go in.Here's what I need... Go down to the cave, poke around inside, kill a few of the trolls, then come back here.Take the road north out of Kharanos, when you get to the bridge, follow the frozen river west until you reach Iceflow Lake.
