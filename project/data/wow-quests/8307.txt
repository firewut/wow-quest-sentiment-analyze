Not only do I miss the birds and trees of Auberdine but our food selection is severely limited by this arid environment.  I'm trying to learn about desert herbs, but there aren't many.I've seen Twilight's Hammer groups from the camp west of here hunt sandworms for food.  Sandworm meat is so bitter though, I can't imagine how they make it palatable.  Keep your eyes open if you go to their camp and let me know if you learn anything.",
