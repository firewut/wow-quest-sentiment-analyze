Now this... demonic emanation.  We must investigate it.The only people who can reopen Karazhan were presumed dead: Khadgar and Medivh.While we hope that the latter is indeed gone, we recently learned that his apprentice, Khadgar, is alive and well in a place called Shattrath City.  Find him and give him Alturus's report.",
