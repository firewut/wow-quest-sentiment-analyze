Normally I'd just sell you one up front, but I'm fresh out of materials.Earth elementals have been popping up on the peak directly south of town. They're a good source of rubble. If you bring me back a good amount, I'll pay you for the restock, and I'll throw in a Boulder-in-a-Box absolutely free!",
