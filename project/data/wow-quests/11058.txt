We call them apexis relics.What we know about them is that, when properly used, they grant a boon.  Each relic presents a colored sequence which, when the crystals are pressed in the correct order, leads through a series of levels, each harder than the last.An apexis shard is needed to power the relic.  Return when you have attained the insight of the apexis vibration.",
