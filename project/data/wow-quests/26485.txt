A brew that'll have them pickin' their tusks out of the hillsides!I've got a few ingredients steepin' already, but I could use a hand gatherin' more. At the bottom of the Overlook Cliffs to the east, near the shore, is a whole mess o' snapjaws. I need fresh, whole gizzards from them for my blastbrew.",
