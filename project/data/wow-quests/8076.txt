    "description": "The demoniac seeks to embody power outright, not just possess it.  More than one of our demoniacs has lost a fight with a demon; with our enemies threatening us - especially in Zul'Gurub - the power that a demoniac is able to unleash on our foes is worth the sacrifice.  Our survival depends on crushing those who would destroy us; the fall of the Gurubashi Empire taught us this.Travel to Zul'Gurub and gain the Paragons of Power we need.  Do this, and a valuable demoniac item shall be yours.",
