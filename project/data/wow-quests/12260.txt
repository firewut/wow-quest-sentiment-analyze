Here, take it. I want you to use it to impersonate one of the Onslaught raven priests.Be quick about it... I have no idea how long my glamour will last while you have the mirror.Realize that you won't immediately be perfectly disguised, so don't count on it being foolproof until I've had a chance to help you.",
