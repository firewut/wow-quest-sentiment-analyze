We need those like Durant to know that we are watching, and we will hold them accountable.\r\n\r\nI know someone who could help us.\r\n\r\nHis name is Arluin. To call him a reluctant ally would be generously overstating it. He is cautious, and will not risk himself without compensation.\r\n\r\nYou can find him in the alleys north of the Evermoon Bazaar.",
