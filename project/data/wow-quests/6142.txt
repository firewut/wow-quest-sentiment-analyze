The best bait to use is soft-shelled clam meat; the fish just can't resist, you know what I mean?Up north you will find a wrecked ship off the coast. Soft-shelled clams are littered throughout the area. If you bring me back 10 pieces of soft-shelled clam meat, I will give you something in return.",
