Venomhides are vicious and must be trained from the moment they hatch.If you want to ride one, you'll need an unhatched egg. Scattered throughout the Marshlands are a number of ravasaur nests. Look for the eggs with lighter colored shells -- those are the ones that will hatch venomhides.If you bring me several of the eggs, I'll allow you to keep one and raise its hatchling, with my guidance.",
