I'm sure they'd appreciate it when they got back!\r\n\r\nI hear that Stormheim goat hair can be woven into all kinds of things. The rarest are from the silver-tail goats. I think I saw some in that mountain over there.\r\n\r\nWhy don't you go and fetch some? I'm sure them tauren would pay you handsomely!",
