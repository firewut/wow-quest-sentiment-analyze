    "description": "The black dragonflight was once noble.  They were the earth warders, protecting the very land itself.  How ironic that they would become the worst menace the land has known.I believe that there remains a sliver of hope, however, and so does my mistress.  The black dragonflight will live beyond Deathwing's treachery, and will soar as the noble earth warders once again.I wish to show you something.  Close your eyes, and I will reveal to you the final part of my studies.",
