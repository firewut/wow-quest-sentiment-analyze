It is good you are here!Since we arrived on Draenor I have dedicated myself to recreating the technology we left behind. This large structure here is a defense ward. It should counter a Shadowmoon advance - provided we power it up.I have prepared resonance crystals at my workshop to the south. Carry one crystal at a time to the three pylons that surround the ward, then activate the control panel nearby!",
