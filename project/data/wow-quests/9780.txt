When Haalrun and I first came to Telredor, we were the only outsiders, but that seems like a lifetime ago.Still, we try to welcome newcomers and ensure that there's always enough food and supplies. We can never fully repay the kindness of the Telredor anchorites, but we can follow their example and extend it to others.If you would like to help, the nearby lakes are populated with a fish called the Umbrafen eel, whose meat is a staple of our diet.",
