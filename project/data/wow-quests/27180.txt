It was a total loss: all troopers were killed and all catapults destroyed.Bloodfang's pack was responsible for the ambush, though likely they have all fled back into the hills, preparing their next cowardly strike. Their day will come, but for now I want you to go to Olsen's Farthing and honor our fallen.Recover their Forsaken insignias.",
