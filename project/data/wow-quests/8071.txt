These mantles are woven with powerful mojo that aids them in judging those who would threaten our tribe.  As a priest, you too must spend your time judging those worthy and not; such a mantle would definitely be a blessing to you.In exchange for fighting Hakkar's minions in Zul'Gurub and bringing me the Paragons of Power I seek, I will give you a mantle worthy of our finest confessors.",
