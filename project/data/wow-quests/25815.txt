Doomed, for on its last voyage the fleet was attacked by red dragons.  Dragons controlled by orcs!We didn't stand a chance against that dragonfire...and our fleet was burned and sunk off this here coast.  I'm the sole survivor of those poor vessels......Bring me my mead, <class>. It's down in the cellar of the inn. As far away as I put it from me, I can't go without it in the end.",
