Clearly they too were affected by the Horde's corruption of the Forest Heart.But, I have an idea for how you can get into Oso's cave and grab the pommel.Ever since I was a faun, I've been pretty good at playing possum. It works great against bears! I can teach you! Go east to the Shady Nook, and if they try to get you, just use my technique.\r\n",
