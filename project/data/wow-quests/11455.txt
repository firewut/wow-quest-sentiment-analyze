Most pirate ships be carrying five or six times as many rats as people.It's no wonder all the bears on this island caught the rabies soon after we moved in.  Long story short, the boss wants 'em all dead.It just so happens I know a recipe for a bear musk fragrance popular among Stormwind nobles.  We kill the bears and sell the musk.  I see a fine business opportunity for us here.  What say ye?",
