Once a hive of activity for the citizens of Wintergarde, now a warzone, filled with murderous geists hell-bent on vengeance towards the living.In the buildings surrounding the town square are trapped villagers that must be rescued! I ask much of you, now, <name>, but you are the only soldier I can spare. Free our people. Take this path down into town square and enter those houses. Kill anything that gets in your way!
