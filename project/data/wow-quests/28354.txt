When I first arrived here I flew around for days to learn the lay of the land. There is a farm east of here that has long since been abandoned and is now overrun by gnolls. On this farm grows a special type of mushroom known as the mudsnout. Go to the stead and gather mudsnout for Kasha. Return here when your pack is full.",
