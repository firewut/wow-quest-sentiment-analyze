I could throw a rock behind me and hit a dozen hobos with motive enough to want to wipe these people (and horse) out.Now I don't know who did this and I sure don't appreciate having to come to this dump to investigate the deaths of a couple of squatters, but I'll be damned if I don't find the perp. You want to help? Go talk to some bums. The hobo... knows.",
