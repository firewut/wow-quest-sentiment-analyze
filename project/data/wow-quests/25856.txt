Things have changed though.You see, not to bore you with a sob story, but when the cataclysm flooded Menethil Harbor, our house went with it. My wife and kids don't have a place to stay, and I need to make as much money as I can to get us under a roof again.I've been skinning crocs 'til I was too tired to move, but I still need more skins to sell.
