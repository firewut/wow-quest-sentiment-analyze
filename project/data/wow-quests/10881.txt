It is rumored they awoke a great evil inside.If that is true, then that evil must have turned against them.  According to these orders, part of the Shadow Council is fleeing Auchindoun.  They are using the Shadow Tomb to store powerful artifacts from Auchindoun.Three of these are sacred, for they belonged to the powerful patriarchs Arunen, K'alen and Atalor.
