It was converted by the Miners' League into a storage depot, but now kobolds have moved in, putting their filthy paws on good, dwarven tools!We'll root out those vermin soon enough, but the League wants someone to get their gear out of the mine before we warriors tromp in there and break things.  It'll be a tough delve - you might want cohorts at your side.The gear is stored in Miners' League Crates throughout the mine.  Good luck.",
