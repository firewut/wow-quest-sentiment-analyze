Just pick some up from the Pilgrim's Bounty vendor if you want to try your hand at making chutney.The recipe should be in your bountiful cookbook.If you've got some extra time on your hands, would you mind making some of the chutney and bringing it down to Jasper Moore outside Stormwind? I promised him I'd trade some for the pie you brought.",
