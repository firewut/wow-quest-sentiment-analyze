I consider my debt to you paid.\r\n\r\nYou must prove yourself to the Bloodtotem chieftain before he will speak with you.\r\n\r\nWithin the forest is the Witch of the Wood, a harpy mother who recently descended into this territory. If you are able to defeat her and show her carcass to the Bloodtotem, they might allow you an audience with Torok.",
