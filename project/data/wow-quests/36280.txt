You in?You're the one that brought a new meaning to pain at the Ring of Trials not too long ago, right? This is the next step in your climb to fame! You've gotta get down here.I'll meet you at my stash so we can talk a bit in private before your big debut.<A map is included with a dollar sign scrawled on an abandoned ogre tower.>",
