I know him from when the Darkspears dwelt in Stranglethorn - he is vicious, and his magic is strong.And if he has the Mind's Eye, then his magic will be stronger still.You must face Mai'Zoth and wrest from him the Mind's Eye.  It is a perilous task, but it is the only hope we have of saving Yenniku.",
