It's always something!But I'm thinking maybe this whole workers-to-stone business could be a big moneymaker for me. What if those guys are now high-quality stone? My whiny employees could be worth more to me as luxury building materials than a source of labor! Grab a stonified mountainfoot miner and haul him or her back to me. ",
