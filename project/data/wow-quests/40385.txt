Our chieftain, Dorro Highmountain, took Talonclaw and pursued the beast, but never returned.I have heard tales of a fearsome nightsaber that now stalks the mists of Stormheim. My brother and I believe this to be our ancient foe.The weapon must be there too! If we kill the beast and reclaim the spear, it will be of great use against the Legion.",
