Our men will fight to the end and never complain no matter what the conditions.That said, we've taken some heavy casualties in this campaign and we've been hitting it hard with little or no sleep for months. That all takes a toll on morale, whether we admit it or not.It may not seem like much, but seeing our standard raised over the battlefield is of considerable comfort to a soldier. Take these banners and raise them at the pedestals in Drak'Sotra.",
