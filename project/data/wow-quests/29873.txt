He's got a brain between his ears, which is more than can be said for most of his kind.He said he was headed east, but, seeing as we're already on the far east side of the valley, I can't imagine he went too far from here. Look for him at Zhu's Watch, in Krasarang Wilds, down the path to the south. See what he's found.",
