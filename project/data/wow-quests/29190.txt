I've always wanted to get a dragon kite and the matron said that if I saved all my money I could buy one, but that's going to be a long time.I think the goblin's name was Blax Bottlerocket or something. If we can find him, could we get some kites and fly them together? I saw him pushing his cart around the Drag.",
