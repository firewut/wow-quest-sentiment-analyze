The amount of crying that a hardened soldier does when it comes down to all-out war is amazing!\"They're jumping into our tower with their horses!\" \"Why is their base so well defended?\" \"They're taking our relief hut, I'm going A.W.O.L.!\"Wimps...I took the first train out of \"cry-town\" the minute the Dark Portal opened. Now I'm a top gun for the Dragonmaw. If you want to be top orc, you'll have to defeat me.We go when you are ready.\r\n",
