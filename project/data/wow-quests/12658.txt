I don't want a pet capable of biting my hand off!However, in the Bonefields to the northeast of the camp, beyond the area dominated by the drakes, there's a large population of goretalon rocs. The grown ones are beyond hope of domesticating, but if you bring me the eggs from their nests, I can raise them from the time they hatch.",
