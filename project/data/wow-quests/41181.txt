I found an ancient text referring to such an object called the Orb of Sciallax.From what I recall in studying the War of the Ancients, Sciallax was a demon lord who came to Suramar and offered the elves at the time a powerful artifact in return for their servitude to the Legion.I haven't discovered the exact location yet as to the whereabouts, but perhaps some digging can yield us an answer.",
