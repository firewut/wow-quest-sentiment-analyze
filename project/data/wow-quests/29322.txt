Think you can handle gathering some of the squirming, sentient slime mold slithering about down there?You can try to fish them up, but they're wily; you might be better off just diving into the ooze and grabbing them.Remember, they're only useful alive and intact... who'd want to eat a dead slime mold?! Disgusting.",
