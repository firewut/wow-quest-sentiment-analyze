He's requested our assistance in tracking them down.If we have any hope of locating those mages, we'll need to find ourselves a reliable hound capable of following a scent.There is only one such hound that I know of, and he's long since retired. It's worth it to check in with his master, Hunstman Blake, and see if old Baron still has it in him.",
