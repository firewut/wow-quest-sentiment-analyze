The battle was bloody and fierce, and there were no survivors.Although the dead were buried, their spirits continue to haunt those ruins.  Of late, I have been receiving visions that these spirits may soon become a threat to Thrallmar.There is only one course of action to take.  We must grant these spirits rest.  You must overcome them in battle.",
