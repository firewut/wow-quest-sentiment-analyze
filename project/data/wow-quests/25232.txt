I'm interested in what exactly they are teaching these neophytes.I only tell you this because you seem to be looking for work.  If you're interested in a little coin, sack the cave and return with their spellscrolls.The cave is somewhat hidden: exit Razor Hill from the east, and follow the canyon's eastern ridge.",
