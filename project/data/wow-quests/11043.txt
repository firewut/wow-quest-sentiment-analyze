If you're going down there, would you speak to them on my behalf? I have some ideas on how to improve their gryphons!Why stop at armoring them when you could attach an altimeter, a rear view mirror, and rocket? Imagine how fast you could go with one of those babies strapped to your gryphon's back! I'll call it the TurboGryphon 8000!",
