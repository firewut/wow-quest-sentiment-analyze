It could be part of one of Valduran's schemes.He's dedicated an extraordinary amount of effort to mining, refining, smithing, and testing this metal.To the east, along the northern mountain face, is a building called Mimir's Workshop. It hasn't been used in quite some time, but if we're lucky, some of its attendants are still functional. Take your armor plate there and learn what you can from it.",
