But if you're looking for a good week's honest work, then head there, meet with Kreldig Ungor, and tell him I sentcha.You can find him holed up at Nijel's Point--it's a little cozy camp hidden in the mountains of northern Desolace. Just head east if you enter from the Stonetalon Mountains. It's easy to miss, so be on the lookout.",
