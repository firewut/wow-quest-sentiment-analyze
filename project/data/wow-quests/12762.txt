Jaloot brought me very special crystal that he found in River's Heart... we seen only one like it before.The crystal not have power now, but the opened up lifeblood pillar should have energy to recharge it if you just bring it close. Once the crystal is charged, go to Sparktouched Haven in far southwest and let the crystal's energy make you big and strong.Then it time to kick some puppy-men butt.",
