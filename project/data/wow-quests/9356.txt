    "description": "Screed likes to say his flying is as \"smooth as butter.\" I think \"butterfingered\" is more like it!Take a look at the wreckage over there. He calls it a \"rough\" landing.Sure, we got shot at, but I'd be willing to cut him a little more slack if he didn't brag about his piloting skills so often!I think I'm going to make him a batch of wings to drive the point home. To the east, in the Valley of Bones, you'll find bonestripper buzzards. Their wings are plump, juicy, and perfect for my needs.",
