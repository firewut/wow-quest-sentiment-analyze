We decided to go for a boat ride, but the clumsy oarsman managed to capsize the craft!When we got back to the shore, Aquinne's moon pendant was missing. The lakes in Darnassus are full of giant catfish who will gobble up anything shiny!I've been catching them nonstop, hoping to find the one with her pendant. I don't suppose you want to help?",
