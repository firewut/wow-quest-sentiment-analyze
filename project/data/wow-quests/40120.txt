It pains me that we see such an end.\r\n\r\nThe creatures set upon us at nightfall. Our men fought bravely, but were vastly outnumbered. Now their corpses lie rotting in the sun, with no burial and no rites.\r\n\r\nThis is not an end befitting to the glorious warriors of Morheim. Make it right, and you will have our thanks.",
