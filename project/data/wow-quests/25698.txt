How it ended up in that murloc's possession, I cannot say, but I can state with certainty that you will find it there.I feel a stronger connection with Sevine than with the rest of Razelikh's servants... possibly because she built the Altar of Storms, upon which you resurrected me.  Bring her Amulet to Lynnore, along with the rest.",
