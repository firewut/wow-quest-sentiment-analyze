Whether that battle is against the Forsaken in Andorhal, against the Scourge in the east, or against some yet-unknown foe is unknown.  What is known, is that we must be ready.We are low on arrows.  I can obtain the shafts and heads, but I still need feathers.  The birds that circle to the northwest typically molt this time of year.  Would you mind traveling out into the field and gathering some of these feathers for our camp?",
