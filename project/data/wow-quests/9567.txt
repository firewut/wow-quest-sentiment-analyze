Although the blood elves are the most immediate threat, there are other sinister creatures that call Bloodmyst Isle home.The Nazzivus satyr are of particular concern. They are foul, demonic creatures, commanding dark magics and feeding on the corruption created by the Exodar's crash.We must hold them in check, but first we must learn more about them. Go southwest to Nazzivian and learn what you can from their grotesque monument.",
