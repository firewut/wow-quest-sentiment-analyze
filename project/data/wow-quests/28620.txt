Send help or I will have them beaten with reeds.\"That's it. It was sent from our chief psylosopher, Nils Beerot. Yea, I have no idea what that means either. Could you please head to Eastpoint Tower and find out what he needs? I can't take any more of these cryptic letters!Just head south and then follow the road east.",
