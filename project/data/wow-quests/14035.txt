    "description": "Every Pilgrim's Bounty feast requires a magnificent centerpiece, and I'm not talking about a decorative horn of plenty, either. No, the focus of the meal is a magnificent roast turkey.There's a good recipe for it in your bountiful cookbook. Why not hunt some wild turkeys and prepare a few? The turkeys wander all over Elwynn Forest, so you shouldn't have a problem finding one.Once you're done roasting them, will you bring them to Isaac Allerton near the gates of Darnassus?",
