Not anymore, anyway. It was stolen. Probably by one of those filthy refugees.Besides, Auchindoun is now defunct. We have no use for the book. If you find it, you can keep it.Like I said, I saw some of those ruffians snooping around the terrace last week. Start your search with them. They're probably playing dice in the slums.",
