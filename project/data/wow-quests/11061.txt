It's an ethereal base, and they aren't too friendly with outsiders, so it might be a little dangerous to obtain.Where's Bash'ir Landing, you ask?  Well, if you get on your flying steed and head north by northeast, well past Forge Camp: Wrath, you'll eventually spot it.  The Bash'ir crystalforge itself is at the northeast corner of the landing.Thank you for doing this, <name>.  It'll mean the world to our sons!",
