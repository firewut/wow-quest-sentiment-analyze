And although it disturbs me some, your race and mine are allies and I would not betray that.I do not mean to be so coy with you--my distrust of arcane magics, be they divine inspired or not, is still strong within me.You will know of what I speak after you return to your Cathedral of Light. Speak to High Priestess Laurena when you arrive.",
