He'll find no easy footing there, Draka will make them pay tenfold for any of ours that they slay, but we must return quickly and chase the mongrels off.\r\n\r\nYou and your forces have proven valuable allies of the Frostwolves. We'd welcome your aid in securing our Wor'gol.\r\n\r\nI'll see you on the battlefield if you choose to come.",
