I also understand that tampering with such balance has consequences.\r\n\r\nThat is why I have taken upon myself to walk this land and perform some... ah... calculations.\r\n\r\nSlay only a small number of the wolves you find, and one alpha. That should reduce their number enough to allow the Sablehorn to thrive without disrupting the flow of things here.",
