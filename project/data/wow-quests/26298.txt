As is a custom with our people, he was given to the Gurubashi Trolls of Zul'Gurub, but after my tribe, the Darkspear tribe, left with the orc Thrall, poor Yenniku was lost to us.  I was sent from distant Orgrimmar, back to Stranglethorn, to search for my chief's son.And I believe the Bloodscalp tribe has him.If you would help me, then hunt the Bloodscalps.  You may find them to the north.  Gather their tusks and return to me.",
