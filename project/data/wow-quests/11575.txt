I was surrounded!A huge magical cube appeared above me. It opened up and pulled me inside. I swear it's true!Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of drakes - It was amazing! My captors scattered and I was able to escape.I never thanked them for saving me. Please, <class>, if you see them, pass on my gratitude.",
