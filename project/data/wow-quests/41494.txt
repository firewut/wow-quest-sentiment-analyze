Once that is done, Mayruna will add a little water from a purified Moonwell and this land will be protected so long as we inhabit it.\r\n\r\nThis is a momentous occasion, my friend. You bear witness to a sacred rite not often performed in the company of strangers.\r\n\r\nI will let you do the honors- simply place the ritual bundle into the sacred waters and we will do the rest.",
