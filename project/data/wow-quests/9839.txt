Without leadership, the Ango'rosh's organization will disappear and they'll resort to infighting to determine who will lead next.Although we've seen the ogres out and about in this area, their true strength is concentrated in their Ango'rosh Stronghold to the northwest. It's located in a cave on a small island connected to the marsh by a fallen mushroom.Go there and defeat Overlord Gorefist. That should provide us with a well-deserved respite.",
