It's growing faster than a baby ravasaur from Un'goro, and if we don't get it under control, the Gearworks is gonna be ruined like our last village.Uncle Krixel used to tell me to burn away the red fungus because that's what makes it grow so fast.You could help us out by taking a flame blaster and clearing out some of those spores down in the shallows.",
