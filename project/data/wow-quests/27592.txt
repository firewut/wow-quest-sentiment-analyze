We were just in the middle of our completely spontaneous beach party when something terrible happened, \"dude\"!I had a whole case of Silversnap Ice, the Baron's own drink of choice, until the silt crawlers stole them!

We need some sort of awesome hero who can help retrieve our specifically-branded favorite beverage!<Brono stares at you a moment.>That means you, \"brah\"!",
