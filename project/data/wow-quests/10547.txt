I couldn't place it at first but the signs are all there...Now if we could get our hands on some bloodthistle, we'd be in business.In my travels, I met a shady Broken in Shattrath named Tobias.Tobias made a business of trading bloodthistle to blood elves for rotten arakkoa eggs.Directly west of here are arakkoa ruins.
