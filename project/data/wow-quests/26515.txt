I've seen those things fight, and there's no way those'll hold if that big brute gets swingin' mad!I want you to find the dire troll and fight him, <name>. Don't kill him... just smack him around til' he's seein' red, then let him break free and get out of his way! He'll be a big pain for the Vilebranch.",
