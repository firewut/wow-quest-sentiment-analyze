The only reason I keep these meat shields around is to keep myself from getting killed.Listen, you're the boss of this operation.  You give the word, and I'll send a fireball right through your target's heart.  If things start getting hectic, I can even warp time a bit so you can fit in a few extra attacks.Why don't we go try fighting together?",
