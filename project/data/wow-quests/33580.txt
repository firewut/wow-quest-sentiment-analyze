Before I was even given a name, I was given a place in society: at the bottom.We are many. We make our homes in the places this world has forgotten.Veil Shadar was such a place, but the Adherents have found it and started a purge. For morale. For fun.Help my people escape, and we'll be in your debt.When the sky burns, it pays to have allies in the shadows.",
