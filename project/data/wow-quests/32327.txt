That means no mounts, no flying, no fighting.I can provide aid. I will magically cloak you, so you may move with stealth. I will also give you a small charm that you may use to return to safety, should you get in trouble.Now go, <name>. Go, locate the bell, and tag it to be teleported back with you.",
