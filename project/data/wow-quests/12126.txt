Thankfully there is a font from which I may draw from in my time of need.Take this unholy gem and make your way to the Ruby Dragonshrine, east of here. It is there that you will find Duke Vallenhal, death knight of Arthas. Weaken his resolve in battle and unleash the power of the gem upon him. It will finish him off and steal his unholy energy!\r\n",
