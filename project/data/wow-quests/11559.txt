One of the best ways to do that is to conduct business with them.The murlocs prize clams over any other object and their only surviving merchant is Ahlurglgr. If I were you, I'd collect a handful of Winterfin clams and give them to him as a gift.The clams can be found all over down in the trench, as well as across it in the Winterfin village and their caverns.",
