During brief lucid moments he demands that I prepare an elixir made from shadow dust carried by the arakkoa.  He seems to believe it will allow him to see into a \"world of shadows\" where the arakkoa's true leaders dwell.I do not believe this nonsense for a second, but I fear he won't rest until I obtain such an elixir.  Will you help?",
