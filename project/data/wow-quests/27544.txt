I'd given up on the Plaguelands years ago, but the Cenarion Circle folks keep telling me that the land is not beyond hope.The most recent visitor was a night elf, on her way to the Fungal Vale, to the north.  She told me that these lands will make a full recovery, if we try hard enough.  I'm not sure I believe her.Do you buy this drivel?  Maybe you and her should talk.  She should still be up there.",
