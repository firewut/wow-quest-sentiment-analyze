I'm not sure what their aims are, but they've already attacked several of our scouts and have besieged the cultists at the Tower of Althalaxx.We've sent a contingent of our best Sentinels to counter their attacks. If you would travel northeast to the ruins and join them, I'm certain that they could use the extra hand.",
