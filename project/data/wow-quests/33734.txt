It was the right decision, of course, but I do long for some of the things we left behind.I am an artificer, a shaper of crystals and gems. Without my tools I am just another refugee.Our town records are kept in a memory crystal in the main hall. With it, I can carry forward the knowledge and legacy of Aruuna.Also, my daughter is terrified - it would be a great comfort for her to hold her favorite doll again.",
