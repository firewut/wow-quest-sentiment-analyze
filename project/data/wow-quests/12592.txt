You're not a bad shot, and Hemet hasn't driven you out, so he must be planning on including you in the hunt.How'd you like to have a bit of a competition, just me and you?Hemet and the others will ask you to help in their hunting. Along the way, you and I will count up the kills we contribute to their goals. Now, this isn't something you can win in the blink of an eye, and you'll find yourself killing many different kinds of creatures. Good luck!",
