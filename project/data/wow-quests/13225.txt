I fell, only to be awoken by the Argent Crusade. They pulled me out of the Broken Front and brought me here. I'm not going to make it. Grant a dying soldier one last wish, <race>? Our base, the Skybreaker, flies high above Icecrown. It is there that you'll find my commanding officer, High Captain Bartlett. Tell him that I died a soldier of the Alliance.",
