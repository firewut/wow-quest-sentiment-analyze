A road leading from the heart of their gruesome fortress to the Dark Portal, paved with the bones of my people.It wasn't enough for them to hunt us down like animals, destroy our cities, and torture those who survived. No, they had to use our bones as paving stones, denying my brethren a proper burial under the Light.Those tortured souls still wander these lands, crying out for release. I ask you, <name>, help me in this undertaking.",
