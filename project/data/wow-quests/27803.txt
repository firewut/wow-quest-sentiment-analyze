They're good lads and they've been holdin' firm, but even the sturdiest dwarf tires eventually.They're split into shifts: one hour of rest for every hour on the line. Best I can get'm with the men we have.If you want to be helpin', pick a line and take up a shift. Give some of my boys a welcome breather. Report back in once you've killed several of the elementals.",
