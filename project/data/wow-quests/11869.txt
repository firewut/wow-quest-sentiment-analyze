It is, as far as we know, the only freshwater giant clam habitat in the world.Of course Nesingwary's lackeys are now using the lake as a giant pearl farm. They must be stopped! A lesson must be taught to those that would think to endanger an entire species.Go to Lake Kum'uya and locate the loot crazed divers. Slay them until the water runs red! Return to me when a proper example has been made!",
