    "description": "The Sunfury briefings support the theory that Kael'thas has been receiving outside help in constructing and running these manaforges.  Who this is remains a bit of a mystery, though we're likely to find out in Manaforge Ara.I've sent a group of my men to scout the surrounding area.  Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of here, and speak to Kaylaan.  See what he's discovered at Manaforge Ara.  Find out who is assisting the Sunfury army and take care of them. ",
