    "description": "The Dark Iron attack took us by surprise. Their saboteurs managed to damage most of our aircraft, steam tanks, and supplies. We were only able to get a few of our bombers airborne.Every technician, recruit, and guard I can spare is  scrambling to get the others repaired and flight-ready. Our infantry can only hold out for so long. Take this equipment and help extinguish the burning bombers.",
