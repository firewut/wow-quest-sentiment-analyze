The cultists mention disguised operatives in various locations in Valiance Keep: the lower docks, the jail inside the inner hold and in the inn's kitchen.Take this oculus.  Use it at those three locations - anyone that has recently used the cult's necromancy will be enshrouded by a dark aura.  Take care of the cultists before something nefarious happens.",
