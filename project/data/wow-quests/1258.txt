And the crabs they have in Dustwallow -- spiny rock crawlers they call them -- will be perfect!The shell of the crab leg is a key element of the dish's presentation so I need pristine, unscarred legs.  An adult crab might only have one or two such legs, and I need a lot in order to research my dish.Head on over to the rocks surrounding Theramore and get me those legs!",
