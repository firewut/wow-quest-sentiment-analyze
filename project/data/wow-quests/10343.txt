The destruction there was the most severe and after the withdrawal of the blood elves, a strange thing began to happen.Beings of pure mana began streaming into the village from all over the area. For now, we're containing them as we can, but with more information about the weapon Kael'thas used, I hope to cut off the flow of mana creatures entirely.",
