At night, you can often hear them chanting about their deeds in battle against people who've tried to settle here.They're determined to drive us from Tabetha's farm even though she's trained generations of apprentices here. We've defended the farm as best we can, but Apprentice Garion was wounded in the last attack.Go to Direhorn Post and kill any Grimtotem you can find! The attacks must stop.",
