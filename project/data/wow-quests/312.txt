    "description": "I had a month's worth of dried meats salted and locked away for the cold season.  Kept it locked so the bears wouldn't get it!  But while I was off hunting deer, that beast, Old Icebeard, made off with the meat locker.  He won't be able to smash through that Thorium though.  But I'll starve if I can't get my meats back.You seem a bit more stealthy than me.  Perhaps you can retrieve my stash?  I'll never make it in and out of that cave fast enough with this bum leg of mine.",
