Those Argent Crusaders and those infernal Cenarion druids have done too good a job of healing the plaguelands, however... and I can't find proper reagents within a reasonable walking distance.Some of the local wildlife retain the plague's touch, however.  Kill a diseased black bear, then retrieve the grass that grows where its decaying body lies.  It's not optimal, but it'll do.",
