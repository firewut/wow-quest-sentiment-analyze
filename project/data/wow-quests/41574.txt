It's a dank, sloppy mess adrift in a sea of gloom.Sounds lovely, eh?I've been workin' with a vrykul guide named Prustaga. She'll help us break the wards keepin' the tomb sealed.I know what you're thinkin'... vrykul are trouble. But she hasn't taken a swing at me just yet.Huey'll take us down to the shore. Prustaga's probably found the tomb by now!",
