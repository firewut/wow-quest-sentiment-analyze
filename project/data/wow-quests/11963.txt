I swear that man has as much heart as any of our soldiers on the frontlines.We cannot let the civilians lose their lands if they're willing to fight for them.  We might not have the troops to spare, but we can send them weapons.These were earmarked for new recruits, but I'll be able to cover those with the ore you've brought me.
