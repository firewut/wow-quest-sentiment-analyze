The echo is merely a twisted reverberation of the anguish left behind by the soul as it is consumed.If left unchecked, the echoes will lash out against the living and stir the spirits of the dead from their graves.In order to restore peace to the Ancestral Grounds, these echoes must be put to rest.",
