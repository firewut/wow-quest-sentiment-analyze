Again, I heard the voice as if it were a breeze in my mind.\"You are needed at the throne,\" it whispered.The voice called itself Kalandrios, and it guided me to this place.I had never been here before, nor had I yet beheld these furies with my eyes; yet this feels strangely familiar to me as if it happened long ago in a forgotten dream.We should greet the furies and hear them out.",
