However, I worry that in our zeal, too many of them will be slain.The Snowfall Glade wolvar have as much right to exist as do we. You and I will see to it that they get that chance.If Elder Ko'nani hasn't asked you already, he will ask you to deal with them.  While you're upon the glade to the north, I'd like you to bag up their pups and bring them back to me.",
