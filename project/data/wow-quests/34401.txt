The arcane shield she guards herself with cannot be penetrated by normal means, but I have a plan.If I had a focusing crystal powerful enough to momentarily pierce her shield, Kaelynara could then be dealt with.Fortunately, we are in the perfect place to build one. Start by bringing me arcane essence from the creatures rampaging throughout the mine.",
