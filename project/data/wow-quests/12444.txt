They used to run logging operations here, but things got a little too dangerous for them.Their abandoned sites are up for grabs and we sure as hell can't let the Horde get their hands on them.The Blackriver Logging Camp is the smallest of the three logging sites in this zone, but we still need it.  Do your part and fend off the Horde forces.  Any lumber they get here will be made into weapons to be used against us elsewhere.",
