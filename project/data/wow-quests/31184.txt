It'd be sealed up in a silver tube, in a footlocker.It's sort of, uh... incriminating. I can't risk any of the crew finding it if they decide to visit the ol' girl. She's resting on the Shelf of Mazu, to the west.I'd suggest riding a rip current out there, if you got the stomach. They're all over the shelf.",
