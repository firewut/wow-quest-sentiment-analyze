As a shaman of the Wildhammer clan, I'm very interested in the shamanic practices of the Bloodscalp tribe.Their magic seems to have diverged in an interesting direction.  If I had one of the totems that their shaman use, I could begin my studies.  You'll find them at the Bal'lal ruins, on the coast to the southwest.",
