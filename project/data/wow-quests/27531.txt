She's not herself anymore.I broke my vows with the Forsaken and joined the Crusade.  Now, I use my knowledge of alchemy to seek a counter-plague agent.  And the Plaguewood is the perfect place to do so.I need to resupply a few reagents, any of which can be found within the Plaguewood.  I'll pay you if you can find any of these items.",
