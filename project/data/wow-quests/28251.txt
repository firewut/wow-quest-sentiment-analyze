My primary job at the ruins was to take slime samples and make sure that the blight that we released was safely dissipating. Simple and easy if not for the worgen that would continuously harass us.I need you to head to Southshore and find my apprentice, Serge Hinott. Make sure that he's ok and inform him that I will return once my work here has concluded.You'll find the Ruins of Southshore to the southeast, near the coast.",
