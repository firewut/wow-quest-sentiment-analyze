With Garona's help, slip inside, gather any info you find, and learn what Gul'dan intends to do.The guards are on high alert. Garona can \"liquidate\" individual guards for you, but she must not be seen! You will have to choose your targets carefully and pick your way through the bastion undetected. Don't let anyone sound the alarm.If things get too hot, I'll teleport you to safety. At least... I'll try.",
