One mistake and I could lose a leg, or my life, and then where would my wife and kids be? Still homeless and without a father to care for them.It's not my proudest moment, but I'll pick my family's safety over pride any day. Please, <class>... hunt Horrorjaw for me. You'll find him in his shady pool to the north, lurking.",
