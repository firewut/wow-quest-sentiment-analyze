When he perished I could not stand the thought that his spirit might not be welcomed into Auchindoun.I interfered and trapped him here. Now he twists and tortures the memories until they cannot be read.You must do what I cannot bear to do myself. Use this elixir to enter the spirit realm......and destroy my son's spirit.",
