We'd just boarded the ship and were headin' back here when we were attacked by a Forsaken destroyer.They boarded our ship, took all the booty for themselves, and then sunk her.That was the last I'd seen of that armor. If you want, you can take my bomber from Scalawag to the dreaded isle that the destroyer be docked. Talk to my woman, Alanya, outside. She'll get you on the bomber.If you manage to find the stuff, don't you dare bring it back!",
