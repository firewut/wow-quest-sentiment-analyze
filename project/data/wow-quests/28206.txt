Her lovely blonde locks and the way they framed her perfect blood elf face... She melted my shriveled heart. I didn't want to send her out, but she was so demanding! I had to give her what she asked for! Who could refuse such a vision?Alas, poor Jenny Awesome has not returned! I fear the worst, <name>. Find her!",
