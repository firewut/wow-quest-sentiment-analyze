We know little about who he was, though the rise of the spirits in this area seems to indicate that it was related to spirit binding.\r\n\r\nWhen you destroy these spirits, a small amount of their essence will remain in this world. Bring it to us - we will analyze it and hopefully learn more about Ogudei's history - and his power.",
