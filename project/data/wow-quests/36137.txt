That means we're going to have to do a little work.While I certainly wouldn't ask you to dirty your hands with manual labor, I do need you to go out and find timber for our mill. Once you mark a tree an able-bodied lazy-good-for-nothing peon will come and chop it down and give you the timber.Frostfire isn't the best place for timber, but I did see a suitable small tree nearby.",
