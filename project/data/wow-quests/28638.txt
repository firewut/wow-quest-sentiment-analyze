I was the first one that told him to sell owl!Mister fancy-pants worgen here says bears taste better, but don't pay him no mind. You should go hunt yourself some owl. There's plenty of 'em wandering just south of here. Stick to the gray ones for now, an' buzz me on the little talky-thing Jez gave you when you've racked up a few.",
