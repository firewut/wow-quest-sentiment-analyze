I worry that if we leave them unchecked, they will soon be joining the assault on our tree, and I'm not sure we're capable of handling that.Go across the way to Fireplume Peak and do what you have to to keep them in check. I'm far more concerned with our safety right now than theirs, so be decisive about it.",
