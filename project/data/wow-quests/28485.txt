Yetimus, lord of all yetis, has grown to a size and strength that our guard simply cannot handle. We fear that should his appetite lead him near Tarren Mill he would devour us all.Gather a party of suitable adventurers and dispatch the beast. He roams the countryside to the west.Bring me one of his horns and I will reward you handsomely.",
