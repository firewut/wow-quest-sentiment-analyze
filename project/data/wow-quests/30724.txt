My wife Suna went to scout the wall with that fool Lao-Chen. Perhaps if he had spent more time preparing defenses and less building that ridiculous ale lift contraption...\r\n\r\nIt matters not. Get a kite from Len, to the west, and then get up there and find my wife. She'll know what to do next.",
