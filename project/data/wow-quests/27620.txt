It was a battle unto itself to keep them from rushing headlong into the middle of this cathedral.That's YOUR job, after all.The cathedral lies ahead of us, the last real bastion of Scarlet power remaining.  Within it, Crusader Lord Valdelmar sits atop Tyr's Hand's crumbling pulpit of lies.There will be no escape; there will be no mercy.  The last simpering vestiges of the Scarlet Crusade end here.  Slay him.",
