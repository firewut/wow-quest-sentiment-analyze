They'd somehow learned that we had the book in our possession and made a very generous offer to \"take it off our hands.\"We didn't ask them what they wanted with the book but the young one kept talking about \"the master's grand design,\" whatever that means.Look, I don't ask questions when money is in play. They gave us a lot of gold and we gave them the book.He said that they lived in Nagrand - in the old Abandoned Armory, north of Telaar.",
