She is void of any emotion aside from the hate she feels towards all others. You must face Edana and bring me back her dark heart.I have heard of a horn that harpies carry -- blowing it by the Hatetalon stones, in the northern part of the ruins, will summon the queen.Imagine her surprise when it is not her kin calling her, but her death.",
