That's what happened.They prefer fresh clams, but they'll pick our crab traps clean if they're hungry enough.The otters in Lonesome Cove are protected by law and we run a legitimate operation here. As much as I'd love to chum those little rats and call it a day, we just make sure they aren't hungry enough to raid the crab pots.Toss 'em a few clams to keep them busy while you're out there.",
