    "description": "I have seen great beasts floating slowly along the rivers of Talador. The 'riverbeasts,' I believe they are called.Their hides are solid, like rock, and yet they float along the waters easily. I would quite like to see one of these up close, if you should head that way. Tormak has created for you another rope, if you are interested.",
