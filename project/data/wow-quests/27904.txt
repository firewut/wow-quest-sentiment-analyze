They are, as far as I can tell, uncorrupted. Those that dwell in the valley move as one with the wind, summoning gusts of breeze at their whim. This pure air may be incorporated into my remedy for poor Magtoor.Please, <name>, gather the smoky crystals found within the grells' bodies for me. I must exhaust every potential cure.",
