    "description": "We were attacked by Prince Navarius and at least a dozen Scourge. I told Dargath and the twins to stay inside the tank, but they wouldn't listen. Dargath looked me in the eyes and said, \"If somebody doesn't get out of this tank, they'll kill us all.\" He then made Reed cut the engine and charged. Most heroic thing I've ever seen.I heard the Prince barking orders to the monsters. Sounded like he was taking them to Thrym's End, northwest of here. We have to rescue our friends. Will you go look for them?",
