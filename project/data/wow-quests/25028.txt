I've been watching these plants bloom and sprout daily - each generation is more mutated than the last. This isn't tribal magic - it's something primal. And dangerous.The day before last a great druid passed through our camp. Seek out Naralex, somewhere in the midst of this jungle. He'll know what to do.And bring him some plant samples from around the overgrowth to help his studies.",
