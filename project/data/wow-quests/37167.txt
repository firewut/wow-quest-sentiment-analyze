If I'm going to start up my academy again, some of them have got to survive this little excursion.While I'm here, I figured I might as well use the opportunity to gather some supplies for my grand opening. You can't start a business without plenty of daggers, after all.Grab me a crate of weaponry from the Grimrail Depot, there should be plenty lying around. I'll have something nice for you.",
