I had hoped to provide the Crusade with a source of fresh food from within the borders of the Plaguelands.However, some of the fish turned out to be predators, and they now terrorize the other animals.  If we're not careful, they will kill them all!Swim down to the bottom of the scar and save some snails, crabs, and pufferfish before it's too late.",
