If you have already met her, then I can give you a bat to fly back to her.Our bats will always fly to the Undercity, but to travel to more remote locales their rider must first visit the area and speak with its bat master.You have met Anette in Brill, so you may now fly bats there.  Speak with me again when you are ready.",
