That is, it wouldn't be easy, if I didn't have the organizational skills of a trade prince's personal assistant!The first trick is multitasking.  For example: the naga explorers to our south carry a valuable ocean reed - Akiris reeds.  We can sell these reeds to our clients overseas, and we can also stuff our visitors' mattresses with them!  Come to think of it, we could probably use some more of that stuff.",
