The Sunreavers normally aren't known for their interest in what goes on down in the sewers, so that's a big indication that they're planning something.Head into the Underbelly, find this Sunreaver agent, and take care of him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let them get it back to Icecrown first.",
