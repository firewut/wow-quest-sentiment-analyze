They may burn them, pillage them, and spit on the rubbled remains, but we'll still fight to take them back.That being said, I rather like them not burnt. I have the boys running buckets from the well to try to keep the fire down. If you'd join them, they can help out by tossing you buckets so you don't have to make the runs.",
