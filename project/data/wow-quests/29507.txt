    "description": "Children are always full of questions about what an archaeologist does and how it works, so I prepared a demonstration for them.I take artifacts and fossils and bury them in the sandbox beside the tent. The children get to dig and make their own discoveries, learn how bones fit together, and see how archaeology can teach them about history.If you have any spare fossils, would you consider donating them to my side project?",
