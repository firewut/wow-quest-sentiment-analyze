So we prepare, and in so doing find what we are made of.I have volunteered to help the Horde by gathering as much peacebloom as possible, so that it can be made into potions for the war. I hope that you are here to lend me your aid. If so, then I need you to bring back to me a good quantity of the herb. Will you assist me, <class>?",
