This castle has been a thorn in my side for too long.Humans from Kul Tiras lived in the castle for years, thwarting my every attempt to crush them.  When the cataclysm hit us, the shore was wiped out, along with the castle and all the humans.  However, these upstarts from Northwatch have moved in to take their place!<Gar'Thok roars in aggravation.>",
