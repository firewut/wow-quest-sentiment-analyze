As of late, they have been acting, shall we say, peculiar.\r\n\r\nI would like for you to send some of our people out to assess the situation. It might be nothing, but I am not fond of situations that I do not fully understand.\r\n\r\nIf we are going to win this war against the Burning Legion, the last thing we need is for something wholly unexpected to occur.",
