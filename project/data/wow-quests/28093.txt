We should find the entrance to Grim Batol just past the next gate.I was ordered to secure the entrance and block off reinforcements while the rest of our men press through the path we've cleared up the canyon. I'm thinking if we get there soon enough, maybe I can let Ticker have a little more fun.Let's get moving down the canyon to the southwest - we should find the next gate pretty quickly.",
