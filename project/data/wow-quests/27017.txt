It was a tough life, but we did alright.But I barely remember any of that.  When I think back to those days, I think about Gloria's smile, or Andrea waving from the window whenever I'd look up from the plow.The farm's just a bit to the east, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go back, <name>.  I'd just like to make sure I hold on to these memories.",
