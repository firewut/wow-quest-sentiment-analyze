Didn't you hear we built a proper sin'dorei outpost here in Hellfire Peninsula?Surely you'd rather be among fellow blood elves and away from all this... smell.  You'll find Falcon Watch in the southwest, beyond Hellfire Citadel.  Report to Ranger Captain Venn'ren; he will take care of you.The road ahead is dangerous and heavily patrolled by Alliance scouts.  I would recommend travelling with companions.  Blood elves, preferably.",
