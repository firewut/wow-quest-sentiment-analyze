Though our beliefs may separate us, I know that we share one goal.\r\n\r\nYou have allowed me to fill my purpose in returning these artifacts to their rightful owners, and for this I am thankful. As for the Scythe of Elune, I can think of no safer place than in your care. \r\n\r\nMay it serve you well against the Legion, <name>.",
