We still don't know precisely what they're doing with all of that power, though.My guess is that you'll find another one atop the Lothalor Woodlands to the south. Once again you'll need to find the person in charge and take whatever controlling device they have in their possession as I'm sure that each focus has its own.Be quick about your business, <class>.
