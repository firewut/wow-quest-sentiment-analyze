I see an amulet, held by the ancient elves...sitting forgotten while its surroundings turn to ruins, until it is captured by demons through treachery and malice.Every night, these sights flow through my dreams. The spirits are warning us. I am too old, and the camp's braves too occupied with guarding us. I must beseech you to follow my visions to the south, to the Darkmist Ruins, and seek out the amulet.",
