I've treated burn victims that spend twenty-two hours a day screaming in pain, and their burns weren't even half as bad as what Hamuul has suffered.Nevertheless, I can sense that he is in greater discomfort than normal today. Bring me the hearts of the large fire elementals to the southeast. I can use them to prepare a soothing salve for our patient.",
