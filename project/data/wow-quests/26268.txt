    "description": "I was at Skulk Rock during the second war. I was young, years before I met my mate, and I still remember the chaos when the Alliance attacked us. We fled with the orcs, without any time to gather our belongings.It was all left behind. Skulk Rock is still full of our old supplies. We could use them here at the village... and more importantly, the Wildhammer shouldn't get their filthy hands on them.",
