I've sold every bit of crocolisk you could imagine.Crocolisk hides, teeth, tails, tongues, eyes, you name it. My point is, they ain't sellin' anymore. There's too many crocs! We're over-supplied and under-demanded.So since they're of no use to me, and they occasionally eat my guests, I need you to just kill the suckers. Do me the favor, eh? I'll be here negotiatin' things with your people.",
