I am no longer in a capturing mood.\r\n\r\nI'll grab my weapon and then head up to the bridge in front of the Gates of Valor. That place is a scary mess full of Felskorn vrykul and demons.\r\n\r\nHow do you think I got caught?\r\n\r\nSo, I'd rather not go back in there. But, I think I know a way to get the demon to come out to us.",
