He's in Ironforge, in the chamber where King Magni holds court.Don't know the way to Ironforge? Take the road out of Kharanos north, cross the bridge, then follow the road east--there are large banners flanking the road--up the mountainside.By the way, if you might avoid mentioning how you assisted me?
