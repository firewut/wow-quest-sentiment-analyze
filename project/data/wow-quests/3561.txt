Heed me when I tell you that I trust this person far less than anyone else I've asked you to meet with.Archmage Xylem has a tower up in the hills overlooking Azshara. He's human, but he acts like no human I've met... or killed. He exudes power, and I dare not ask him what he plans on doing with the tablet.He came to me, but told me that his bodyguard Sanath would help me get to the tower when I was ready to meet him.
