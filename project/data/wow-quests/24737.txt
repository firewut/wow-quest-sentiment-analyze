How does that sound to you?I thought so!We're going to be making some glue. Head to the tar pits just north of here, and collect me some tar. Not just any tar, now, you'll need to get it from the beasts that live around the tar pits. As a bonus, if you use my tar scraper on their corpses, you'll keep your hands nice and clean.",
