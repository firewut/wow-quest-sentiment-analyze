If we can shut it down, we can deprive the Lich King of a large component of his armies.I've sent Darkrider Arly to the area. She has a small base, Blackwatch, on a ridge overlooking the Fleshwerks and to the west of Corp'rethar. I'm told the Argent Crusade is sending someone to coordinate their efforts there, but the darkrider will know what to do. Find and assist her.",
