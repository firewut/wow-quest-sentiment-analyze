It is they who oversee the retrieval of a so called \"warp-energy\" by the manaforge and its delivery to a remote destination via a system of underground pipes.The only other specialists in the area are geologists.  Everyone else is either part of the military or a magister crony; both easily replaced.Get in there and kill Kael's specialists; that's what'll hurt him the most.",
