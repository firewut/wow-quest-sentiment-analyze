Maybe you can lend a favor or two more to the troubled Wildhammer that have made refuge here.We were all forced to retreat to this building quickly, and some of us left behind things of great value in our destroyed homes nearby. Would you mind bringing them back after you go out there? You would bring happiness to some very troubled souls.",
