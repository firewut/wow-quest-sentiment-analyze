Under his leadership, he's turned them into little more than brigands. There's no negotiating with his type; Tortusk must be destroyed.If our prisoner is to be believed, you'll find Tortusk southeast of here at a place called Thorn Hill. Search the bluffs where he has a commanding view of the road. Kill him, <name>, and the immediate threat should cease.",
