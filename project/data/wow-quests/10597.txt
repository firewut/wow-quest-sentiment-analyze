That's not a request, <name>; it's an order.The Fetid Pool near Legion Hold holds an old fel reaver power core you could use as the basis for a kind of fel bomb. Search the other wreckage near the fel reaver for a section of armor plating. You should be able to make a bomb powerful enough to take out those infernals and give the hold a nice shake!",
