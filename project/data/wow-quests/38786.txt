Our smiths can coax great power out of it, but as miners, we must treat it with respect, or else its power will retreat inward.<The tauren hands you what appears to be a GLASS mining pick.>The next time you mine some leystone ore, use this pick. It will break if you strike too hard. THIS is the respect that leystone requires.",
