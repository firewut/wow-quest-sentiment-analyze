You have no idea what I'm talking about, do you...I don't have time to fill you in on all of the details, but we had a town in Darkshore, Auberdine, that took some of the worst of the Cataclysm. We're in the process of rescuing some of the survivors, but I need someone with a bit more experience--someone like you--to check in on a refugee camp that we heard about in the south.Leave things to us up north. Head straight down there and help the refugees however you can.",
