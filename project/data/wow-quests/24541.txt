I need the real stuff.\r\n\r\nDon't just go over there and buy it! I don't want you giving these scumbags one copper. Nah, you gotta get it from the source, discreet-like.\r\n\r\nI'll disguise you as a package runner. I saw a stockpile guarded by their goons outside the gates. Go run by, and DON'T stop, or they'll make you! They'll toss you a crate. Bring it back here.",
