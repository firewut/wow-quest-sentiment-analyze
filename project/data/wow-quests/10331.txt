I brought it out here with me to finish the shoes for some of old man Amorlin's horses, but I can't find it.I've searched the barn no less than a half dozen times and I just can't seem to find it. Maybe one of the other apprentices retrieved it and took it back to the smithy? Would you be willing to go down there and take a look? The workshop is to the southeast of the tower in the Town Square.",
