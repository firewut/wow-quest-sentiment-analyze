He's got the wildlife up there hooked on kafa with his scheming.Kafa'kota is more scarce than ever with goots gobblin' it up and yetis hoarding it in their caves.Uncle Keenbean will pay you good for any berries you bring down from Kota.Here, take a sample. Eat it. See for yourself the power of kafa.",
