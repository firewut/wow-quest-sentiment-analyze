Well played.Toldrek already swam up to catch it, all concerned about currents and what not. He said you'd get the honors though. Nice guy - don't know how he lasts.Go to the top with the balloon, take the flare gun from the crate, and scan the horizon for Horde ships. If you see any, fire the flare towards them. That's it! All there is to it.Swim. Float. Flare. Rescue! That last part's my favorite.",
