They returned and re-lit the flame but Old Murk-Eye coerced the weaker minded murlocs to raid the Lighthouse with him once again.  The second time the family was not so lucky and before my eyes they perished helplessly.Slay Old Murk-Eye if you see him along the shore and bring me one of his scales and I shall reward you.",
