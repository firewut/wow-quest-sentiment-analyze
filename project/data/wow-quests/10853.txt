They used to be black drakes.But then, with the destruction of this world, a wave of nether energy washed over everything and had the side-effect of changing the drakeling eggs.Now they are all twisted versions of their former selves.  We must help them to find peace.Do this by slaying a drake near to the spirit calling totem, and then take its spirit from it.",
