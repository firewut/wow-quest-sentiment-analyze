Go bash fishy. Bring Mud food. You feed Mud or Mud eat you.\"So I got him those fish and he ate 'em up. That's when I started too. The heads are the best part, all soggy-like.Don't crush those heads now. It makes them sad. Sad heads aren't good eating. Get me happy heads and I'll eat them and be happy too.",
