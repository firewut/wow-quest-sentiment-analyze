I have seen similar effects on my shieldmaidens, and now they are trapped by Helya's minions.\r\n\r\nI may know a way, however. The Kvaldir ships carry special lanterns bound to this place to navigate through the fog. It is said that the light of these lanterns can release bonds of the spirit.\r\n\r\nThere is a kvaldir ship nearby. See if you can find one there.",
