When Jaxon and I are out in the field 'hunting,' we've been collecting pieces of the ethereal eco-dome generators and hiding them in the nests of our prey, the raptors in Eco-Dome Farfield.It's a remote area to the northeast of the Stormspire, close to the Netherstone. I don't anticipate you'll run into many ethereals there, but would you be willing to help us collect the dome generator pieces?",
