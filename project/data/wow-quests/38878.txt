I don't have time to explain in detail - just know that it is vital to the Forsaken that we succeed.\r\n\r\nThe shieldmaidens have proven tenacious in their defense, but I believe there may be another way in. A chosen few of their order are allowed entrance, and I need you to find out how.\r\n\r\nIn the town I have seen intricately engraved shields which I believe are passed down from these champions. The scenes they depict may be the key to passing into the vault.",
