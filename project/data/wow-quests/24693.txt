There is, however, another place where I might have use of you.My business associate, Gremix, has a camp northwest of here, on the opposite side of the volcano.  He's a savvy business mind, and has a better eye for profit than even I do.  I'm sure he could put you to work, if you'd like to make some more coin.",
