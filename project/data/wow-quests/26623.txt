I know it's a bit disgusting, but the cakes have a nice, tangy flavor and make great snacks!If you want to try some still, I'm afraid I'm out of meat. I need some lump meat to whip up a few more cakes.Venom Web Spiders are a good source - they nest to the north, between the foothills and the river.",
