If you don't unearth an ancient evil or get cursed by wicked spirits at least once in your career, you're not digging up anything worthwhile!No, the real archaeologists know that a little thing like fossilized bones reanimating into skeletal creatures is no reason to stop working.I still need those fossil bones.
