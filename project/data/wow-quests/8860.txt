It should be pretty nice... but Booty Bay is also having a party today; I bet it'll be even better!Well anyway, Innkeeper Allison in Stormwind needs a supply of Smokywood Pastures fare to help feed all the party goers.  Can you do me a favor and deliver it?Thanks, <name>!  Innkeeper Allison is in The Gilded Rose, in the Trade District of Stormwind.",
