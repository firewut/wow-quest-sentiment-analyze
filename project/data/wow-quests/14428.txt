I have not yet probed the extent of her abilities: I'm hoping you can give me a full report by engaging her in combat and destroying her.With a title like 'Lorekeeper,' I'm guessing Amberwind will have a journal on her that'll tell us exactly what those night elves are up to. Fetch that journal for me. No need to run back; use their own scrying stones to contact me remotely.",
