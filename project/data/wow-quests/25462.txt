The fires drove the little ones up the trees, where they've gotten stuck. We've got to get those bears safely to the ground!Flying creatures frighten them, so you'll have to climb the trees yourself. Look for footholds at the trunks. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and toss them - GENTLY! - onto the target here.Nothing can go wrong with this plan.",
