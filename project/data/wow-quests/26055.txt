Bless the boys, bless their hearts.O'Breen made it to shore safely but we weren't so lucky. The seas just sank on us, I swear.One second we're afloat and the next water is rushin' in. And those beasts! Killed all the survivors. Horrible naga scum. I went black and ended up here, saved.I want those beasts dead.",
