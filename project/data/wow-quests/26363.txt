I'd like you to investigate the summit of Jintha'Alor.We were prepared for our fiercest battle there, to storm their dark altar, but it's too quiet. Not a sound. It could be a terrible trap, and someone strong should look into it first instead of all of us rushing in.And if it's not a trap... I'm very interested in finding out what happened up there. Bring me back any clues you can find.",
