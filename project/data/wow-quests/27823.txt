It's just that... well, we do so much diggin', and so little drinkin', that sometimes I wonder if I should just hang up me shovel and head back to Ironforge.But not today.  I've got some diggin' in me yet.Those Dark Iron dwarves at Hammertoe's Digsite - just north of here - make some powerful fine beer, right here in the desert.  You think you could pick up a few for me?",
