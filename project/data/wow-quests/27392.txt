I wasn't supposed to touch his swords, but I knew where he hid them.One day, he told my mommy that he was going to fight a \"lone hunter\" in the hills to the east, but he brought his animal sword with him!  When he came back, he didn't have his sword with him.When daddy comes back, he'll be so happy when I give him his animal sword!  Will you go and find it?",
