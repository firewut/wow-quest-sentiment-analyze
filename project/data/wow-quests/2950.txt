I'll improve your ring for you, better than whomever made this simple little thing could have ever done.  Probably some gnome...If you bring me a bar of silver, a moss agate, and thirty silver coins for my trouble, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will strengthen the magic inside of it.  Interested?",
