We'd lost two of our number in an earlier battle, so we were quick to attack and lay waste to the caravan.We left their supply crates, thinking that our torches would destroy anything of value, but given that Venture Co. salvagers have been spotted near the burned wagons, maybe we were wrong.Perhaps you could go to the caravan and examine the contents of the crates.",
