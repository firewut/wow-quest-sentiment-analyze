His name's Kadrell, and he's usually patrolling the road through Thelsamar in Loch Modan.To get to Thelsamar, go southeast through the tunnel, then turn northeast when the path forks into a road.  Follow that road straight into Thelsamar.Give Mountaineer Kadrell this cask of Shimmer Stout and see what he thinks!",
