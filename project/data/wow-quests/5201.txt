However, there is an annoyance that seems firmly rooted here in Winterspring: the Winterfall furbolg.Although I have never directly attacked the furbolg, they seem crazed, fearful of anything in their path. I have watched them slay countless creatures that had the misfortune to simply be in the wrong place at the wrong time.I am weary of their meddling -- please, help me by fighting back. Slay the furbolg and keep them away from Frostsaber Rock.",
