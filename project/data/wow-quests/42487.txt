See if you can reroute it and return to her that way.\r\n\r\nOh, and before you go:\r\n\r\n<Vanthir hands you a wrapped bottle of Arcwine.>\r\n\r\nTake this to her, with my thanks for sending you. Let her know that your efforts helped replenish our Arcwine supplies and reunited a mother and child.\r\n\r\nWe are grateful beyond measure. Farewell for now.",
