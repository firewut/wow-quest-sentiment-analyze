They even desecrated the remains of the elder in the wagon.And for what? So they could humiliate us and display their power. Not even Boulderfist would have sunk so low.I am a spiritual orc, <name>, but even I have limitations. Find the attackers at Warmaul Hill to the northwest and destroy them!",
