    "description": "Warlocks tread dangerous ground in dealing with demons, but our demoniacs take this one step further.  Through an ancient and arcane ritual, they allow a demon to enter their being.  Rather than let it possess them though, they enslave the demon from the inside, absorbing the power of the beast for their own command.  It is a feat few are ever able to master.For you to learn of the power of the demoniac, I must have Paragons of Power from Zul'Gurub.  Go there and retrieve that which we seek.",
