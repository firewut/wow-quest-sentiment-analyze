But no doomed destiny will prevent me from serving our Dark Lady.  When the call arose I sewed body bags for the fallen soldiers of Sylvanas's mighty army.Now my hands shake from the chill.  If you would bring me five duskbat pelts, I could sew myself a blanket.  Help me, <name>, so that I can continue to serve the cause.",
