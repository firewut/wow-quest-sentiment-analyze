Hunters claim to be much like our tribe's predators - to seek the hunt is to embody the essence of the predator, yes.  Your hunt in Zul'Gurub, however, will show us how you truly rate amongst our finest predators.Bring to me a sampling of the Paragons of Power from within Zul'Gurub.  Do so, and you'll take first steps in becoming the penultimate predator.",
