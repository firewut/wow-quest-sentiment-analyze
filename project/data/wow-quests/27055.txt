The first is the practice of spreading disease through the animals of the plaguelands, which you already knew about.The remainder of the plague is being shipped to the Weeping Cave, a cavern north of Malicia's Outpost, for use in some dark experiments.  Students of the Scholomance are using this plague to re-animate the dead!Certainly they must be stopped.",
