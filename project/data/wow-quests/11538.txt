As long as their morale remains high we will not wrest the building from their control.The emissaries of hate are Legion shocktroopers deployed to reinforce tactical Legion positions.  The enemy rallies around them for they fear them more than they fear us.Today we will change that.  Take this banner and slay the demons of the Legion.  When you meet the emissary, slay and impale him.",
