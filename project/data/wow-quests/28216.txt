Wiped off the face of the planet in a wall of fire!The Twilight's Hammer is to blame, and the survivors say it were the work of one Magmalord Falthazar. He's an ascendant - that's what they call the highest echelon of Twilight's Hammer cultists who become one with the elements. He's a creature of pure fire.And he'll soon be a creature of pure dead! Go kill Falthazar at the Humboldt Conflagration and bring me his head!",
