Of course, we can't do that without some heavy grade munitions. Unfortunately, most of our stockpile is being used up by the goblins and blacksmiths for our siege tanks and weaponry.We do happen to have a pretty good supply of the stuff out in Mightstone Quarry - underneath all the Nerubian crap. You'll just have to go out and get it for me.",
