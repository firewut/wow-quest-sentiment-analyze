    "description": "Long ago a caravan went to Auchindoun with a mission to take a Dread Relic from the ancient tombs beneath the necropolis. They fled, but the relic was their undoing.  The relic is evil and it summons evil when touched.   Their caravan was destroyed somewhere to the east. This dark artifact is the key to a terrible plan to defeat Teribus the Cursed, a creature that flies over the Bone Wastes.  Help me if you wish, but your life and even your soul will be at risk.",
