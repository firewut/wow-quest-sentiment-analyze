We must make our way there and track her down.\r\n\r\nI had previously dispatched Commander Lorna Crowley and a detachment of Gilneas Brigade to scout the position. Meet up with her there and find out what Sylvanas is after.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I will muster the fleet to assault their outpost. We will have justice if I have to reduce their camp to rubble!",
