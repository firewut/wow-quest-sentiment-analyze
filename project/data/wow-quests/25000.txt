He's in charge of keeping the supply routes open.He's got two of the most ornery dwarves I've ever met in charge of sundries. If you want to make an impression on those two crotchety hunters, you're going to need to show that you can hold your own against the predators around here.The raptors west of the hold here are especially vicious. Bring Goucho some fresh hides and you'll make an impression while supplying the troops in one swoop.",
