It gives me the perfect opportunity to do what I came here for; to gather information on the Bladespire.I can leave at any time, but I would like to have my sword and shield back.Two of their leaders have my trappings.  Droggam has my sword and Mugdorg has my shield.If you have need, obtain and use the brew from Bloodmaul Outpost to the south to thin out their help and entice those two, but beware their sober guards who don't drink!",
