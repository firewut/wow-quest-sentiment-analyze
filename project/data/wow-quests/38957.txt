We'll need to come up with some patterns on our own.I've been thinking about the leather breeches that the Stormheim vrykul wear. They're certainly much thicker and heavier than anything we could sew, but their embellishing runework is quite impressive.If I had a few pairs, perhaps I could re-imagine this runework on a more... refined garment.",
