But a horrible nightmare has taken hold in the Dream, and now I fear that Ysera is being affected by it.Recently, I asked her to aid in the fight against the Scourge that are raising frostwyrms at the other dragonshrines. She misunderstood.Instead, she told our dragonshrine's defenders to treat those not of the green dragonflight as enemies.I need you to slay some of the skytalons. The shrine must regain its balance.",
