He wants us to believe he's chopping wood, but he never returns with more than a few twigs.He usually goes toward the ruins southwest of the Mirror of Twilight. He spends a lot of time out there, even for a squire with responsibilities to his knight.Find a way to distract or incapacitate him and search him. If he's up to something, we'll know it.",
