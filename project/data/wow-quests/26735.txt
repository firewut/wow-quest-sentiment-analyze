We were under the command of Colonel Kurzen, until he and those close to him started to descend into madness...We rebelled, set up camp here, and stood against Kurzen.  Now, my sources are telling me Kurzen has disappeared.  I trust my source, but it would help to hear from a third party.  Please, head into the compound and find some documentation of his fate.",
