The terrible fate that awaits Azeroth could come in days or years; time has no meaning for beings of his power.When the stars are favorable, he will lash out against all living beings with terrible wrath.  You must find him before then and find a way to bring his existence to an end.Do this and bring me a piece of his husk.  I shall grant you armor no mortal has ever worn... armor fit for one who has slain a god!",
