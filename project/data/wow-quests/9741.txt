Needless to say, we found it...<Loryi points at Jorli.>Whatever those fool elves are transporting through that portal is causing void energy to be released. The area is teaming with void critters. We must destroy them before they have a chance to grow into void anomalies. You'll find the source of the creatures southwest of here, near the sun gate. Kill them and report back to Aesom when you're done.",
