The Jewelcrafter's Association, however, won't let us market it until we've completed some humanoid testing - something about tinkering with magical dust being dangerous or some such nonsense.  Well, I suppose we need to humor them.  Take this bag and test out Stardust No. 2 on some humanoid subjects.",
