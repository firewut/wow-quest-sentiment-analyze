As we were moving across the upper ledges of this island, a group of Ethereum jumped us. At least I think it was Ethereum. They had the same energy color but their wrappings looked void.Only Tyralius was spared. I think they put him in a prison cell.I've got to get back to the Protectorate Watch Post! Can you escort me back?\r\n",
