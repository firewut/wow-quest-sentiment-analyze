When the first tentacle burst from the ground the ill sentinels began attacking us. We lost the outpost shortly after...The sentinels in the peak are now nothing more than shells - husks for something far more sinister. I want you to put the sentinels to rest and retrieve their glaives. Each glaive returned can identify a fallen sister.",
