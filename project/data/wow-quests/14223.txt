Once the Horde launches its Desolace campaign, our work here will ensure that nothing takes us by surprise.Recently, one of our scouts was caught and sacrificed by the Burning Blade at their stronghold to the east. Since then, we've been assaulted with threats and taunts from a Burning Blade wretch named Kohor.Their days here are numbered, but I will pay handsomely for that one to be silenced now!",
