The conquest of Jintha'Alor isn't enough... the trolls could regroup and summon this creature later, when we're not expecting it.We'll gather the artifacts first, pull Shadra into this world on our own terms, and put our hammers to that foul creature. I'll need you to help find the artifacts, and put a hurt on the rest of the trolls while you're at it.We first need the Eye of Shadra, guarded in Agol'watha to the north.",
