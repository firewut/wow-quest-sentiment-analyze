We'd have never found it had it not been for the distress signal that it was faintly emitting.We think one of our own might be locked up in there but we have no way of opening the orb up without harming whatever is inside.What we know about the Ethereum is that any of their members could - at any given time - be carrying a key to unlock an orb. Retrieve one and return so that we may uncover the mysteries of this orb.",
