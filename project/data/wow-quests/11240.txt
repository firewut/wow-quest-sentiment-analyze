My guess would be that we're gearing up for an offensive to clear out the rest of them, and the captain wants their head lopped off, as it were.Do me a favor? Head back into Whisper Gulch and put an end to Squeeg Idolhunter. From what I remember, my guess would be that he's in the cave in the northwest corner.",
