Like Rend's pretenders before them, this false Horde too will fall, and its banner will adorn the wall of Grommash Hold as a testament to the Warchief's might.It falls to you to carry out the Warchief's will in this matter, <name>. It will not be an easy task, for the banner is guarded by a champion of this Fel Horde, known as Warbringer O'mrogg, and he will not yield his charge without a fight.",
