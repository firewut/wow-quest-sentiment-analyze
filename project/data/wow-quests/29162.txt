But the spiders from the Firelands are worse than icky. They're burny, and don't belong here.Find the fire portal in the western Regrowth, and use the gem I gave you earlier to force it open. When a fire spider emerges, step on it! Unless it's big. Then, do something <class>y to it.Oh, and use the gem if spider venom makes you woozy!",
