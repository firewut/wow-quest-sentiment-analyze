You were key in ensuring that our loved ones made it home, and I hold some hope that you may yet help us further.Like Laird, their wounds will be grave - every one of them battered by the coast and assaulted by the elementals. I am doing what I can, but it seems that those elementals hosted a toxin that is weakening their ability to heal. I believe I can concoct a salve, but I will need secretion from the muscles of the clams that inhabit this coast. Can you help me?",
