    "description": "Our small outpost is under constant attack. Several nights ago, we were raided by the spiders of Netherweb Ridge, on the southeastern edge of the Bone Wastes. They poisoned many of our people, wrapped them in webs and carried them away. Some of our warriors took up arms and with little preparation pursued the spiders.We have not seen the captives or our hunting parties since. We hope that some may still be alive, perhaps imprisoned by the spiders.  Our numbers are few. Will you search for our people?\r\n",
