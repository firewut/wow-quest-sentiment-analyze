I have a few other recruits bringin' some over as well, but I have a special one dat I've been promisin' Moraya for a while.Swiftclaw be one of our fastest and bravest young raptors yet, but he can be a bit unruly. I'll lend ya da lasso, I just need ya to catch him somewhere on da island here and steer him over to da pens on da main isle. I doubt he'll be makin' it easy on ya though.",
