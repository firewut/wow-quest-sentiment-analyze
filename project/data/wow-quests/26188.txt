He told me of its demonic red eyes, razor-sharp talons and venomous bite.As fortune would have it, while traveling across the plains, I encountered it, and it took a nasty bite from my shoulder. He was as terrible as my grandfather described. I have gathered all the parts of the remedy I need to cure myself... except a flatland cougar femur.I grow weaker by the moment... please, help me.",
