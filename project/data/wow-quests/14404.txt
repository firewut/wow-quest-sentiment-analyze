Well, we had that very same idea all on our own after these Forsaken started showing up.We were thinking the water would be the safest way out of here.Unfortunately our boats didn't come out from that last earthquake unscathed.I need some additional supplies to finish my repairs: wood, tar and my tools.  Get them for me so that my brothers and I can make it out of here.",
