He decided to take it upon himself to continue our research using MY inventions. Anyhow, he had some of his Horde goons using my arcano-scorp probes at the Ruins of Baa'ri lava flow and discovered the mother of all diemetradons!I need you to get there before he does and kill the diemetradon, Felspine, and bring his hide back to me.Hurry up!",
