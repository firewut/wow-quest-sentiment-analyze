Mayor Heathrow has been under a lot of stress recently.I can't blame him: his own daughter, Penelope, has been missing for two days.In fact, we could use information on several farmsteads to the south: Mayor Heathrow's house, Granny Marl's farm, and the Radcliffes' dock. Can you go check on the situation out there?Help us, and perhaps the mayor's heart will soften.",
