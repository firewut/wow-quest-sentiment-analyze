From the battlefields of Lordaeron to the deepest jungle, I have rarely witnessed such prowess with weaponry as you have demonstrated.You have killed the ferocious Sin'Dall, the elusive Bhag'thera, and the treacherous Tethis.  But the true prize is the head of King Bangalash.  That white tiger is the reason I am here... yet still, he taunts me from his roost to the south.
