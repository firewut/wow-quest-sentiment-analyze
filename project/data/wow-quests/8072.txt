Legend states that when facing the enemies of the tribe for the first time, Kar'xavan used his mantle specifically woven with \"the weave of madness\".  His form was shrouded not only by the mantle, but also with the blinding speed of his twin daggers.  Madcaps today cherish their mantle as a sign of their place in the tribe.Bring to me the Paragons of Power I seek, and such a mantle will be yours to weave madness unto your own enemies.",
