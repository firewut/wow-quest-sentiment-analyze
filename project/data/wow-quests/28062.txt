His acolytes can easily revive him.  Instead, we are going to banish him.I asked you to gather a precious stone from the Twilight's Hammer earlier.  You will now use it against Calcinder.  Engage him, weaken him, then use this device on him.  He will be banished from this realm.Good luck, brave <name>.",
