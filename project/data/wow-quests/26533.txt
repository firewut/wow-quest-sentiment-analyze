The reasons why aren't all that clear, but I'd guess it had something to do with his tendency to administer powerful, behavior-altering drugs to anyone he saw.  Anyhow, the Gurubashi priests and their blood god have been slain, but Zanzil the Outcast remains......as do his powerful, behavior-altering drugs.I'd like to get my hands on some, <race>.  Check the zombies to the southeast.",
