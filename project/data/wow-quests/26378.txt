The crime rate of the area has skyrocketed as people fight for shelter and food. Now I hear tale of murder!If you are interested in helping the people of the Alliance, Westfall would be a great place to start. Report to Lieutenant Horatio Laine at the Jansen Stead. You'll find Westfall directly west of Elwynn Forest.",
