I'm here to find Azuregos and take him to safety, if only he would let it be that easy.Azuregos doesn't make many friends, and his taste in them tends to be a bit... unique. The only one I know of here is a murloc named Ergll. You should be able to find him on the coast northeast of here.Do whatever it takes to find Azuregos and send him to me.Please hurry.",
