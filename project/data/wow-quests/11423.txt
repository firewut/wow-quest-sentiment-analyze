Their houses will burn, their corpses will be devoured by our plagues, all trace of their existence will be lost.This worries me as a seeker of knowledge.  The eastern town of Nifflevar will soon be razed by our forces in Vengeance Landing.  The vrykul bard, Helgus, lived there and wrote three sagas: the Saga of the Twins, the Saga of the Winter Curse and the Saga of the Val'kyr.  Obtain them before Nifflevar is destroyed.",
