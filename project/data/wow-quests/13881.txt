Just to our south, beyond the bear shrine, an entire generation has fallen ill. Gruesomely ill.<name>, I don't know what they're suffering from, but it's consumed them from within. It pains me that a whole generation is beyond saving, but we've got to kill them off so that the earth can reclaim their bodies.More importantly, we need to find the source. Investigate the shallow lake they drink from!",
