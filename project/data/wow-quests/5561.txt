Ever since I learned how to rejuvenate and control aged kodos with my kodo kombobulator, the caravan owner Cork, Rigger, and I entered a partnership.Take the kombobulator and use it on any ancient or aged kodos; it will jolt the beast into a tamed kodo and force it to follow you.  Once you have a kodo tamed, bring it back to me.",
