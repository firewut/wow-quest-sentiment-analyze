I have seen owlbeasts enter and leave Mazthoril, even after Umbranse took control. Their ancient druidic magic must be capable of disabling Umbranse's. Luckily, I happen to be somewhat of an expert in their methods.Travel south, to Dun Mandarr. You will find a chest with a dreamcatcher in it.That will be your first step.",
