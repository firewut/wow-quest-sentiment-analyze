Even so, at Stonebreaker Hold, Rakoria awaits word of our progress.She's sharp and capable, <name>, but be careful around her. She's got a lot of goods she's eager to move along the roads, but don't assume she's got our best interests at heart. Rakoria goes where she believes there's profit to be found.",
