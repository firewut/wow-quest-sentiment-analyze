In the Alliance tongue, he is known as \"Goldrinn.\"I don't need to tell you how important the wolf god has been to the Horde - his tenacity under adversity has been an inspiration to all of our disparate races.Southwest of here, down in the valley, lies a shrine to Goldrinn. My friend Takrik Ragehowl was refurbishing the shrine when I stopped hearing from him. I fear the worst.Please find Takrik and make sure the shrine is okay!",
