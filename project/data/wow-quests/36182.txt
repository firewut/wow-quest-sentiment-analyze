I reckon it murders trees - but more importantly it will allow for the harvesting of large timber. Do you know how much timber a large tree holds? Me neither, but I bet it's a lot!There's a large piece of timber ready to be murdered nearby. Why don't you give the contraption a test run? Bring me back whatever it harvests and I'll put it to good use.",
