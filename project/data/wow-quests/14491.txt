When the very earth itself tore apart, the spirits of the land they had abused rose up and took their revenge.The agitated earth spirits still roam the former dig site, <name>.  We must offer them appeasement.Take this drum with you to the west and play to the spirits.  The rhythm may calm their fury and confusion.",
