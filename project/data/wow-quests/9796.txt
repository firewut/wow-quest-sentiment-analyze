Mokasa at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar is eager to hear of our progress, especially since most of her messengers travel through here.She asked me to send word once Swamprat Post was completed. If you wouldn't mind delivering the news, I'd be very grateful. We may be up and running, but there is still much to be done.To get to Stonebreaker Hold, follow the road south out of Zangarmarsh, into Terokkar Forest and beyond Tuurem.",
