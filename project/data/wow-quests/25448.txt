Even without his meditation leaving him vulnerable, there's enough threats in this forest to keep both of us on our toes.That's why it maddens me so much that I don't have the opportunity to leave camp. More harpies than I've ever seen infest the northwest...foul creatures, spreading their filth across the ancient ruins uncaringly.They're a threat to this camp, and have no place in these lands. I'll pay you well if you get rid of them.",
