I expected murlocs along the coast down below, but I never thought I'd see this!The Scourge are down there, and they're changing murlocs, and anything else they can get their hands on, into the walking dead!<Class>, we will not suffer them to create more of their kind, especially not from murlocs! There is a ramp down to the beach just northwest of the camp. See to it that you deal with the Scourge in a timely fashion!",
