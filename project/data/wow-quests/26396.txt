If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my gryphons to him.That's a good lesson to know: gryphons are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote gryphon master after you've already been there.You've already been to Bartlett, so just speak with me again when you're ready to take a gryphon to Goldshire.  Once there, you can deliver Osric's Crate to Smith Argus.",
