She also stole one of me best ships - the Horizon's Edge - and has it anchored off the shore of Azsuna as we speak. If you help me take back me ship, then her cursed blades are yours.Now, assuming that sounds agreeable, meet me aboard the Crimson Veil. We have her docked right in Booty Bay - not a cheap arrangement.",
