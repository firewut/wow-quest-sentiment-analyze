I've prepared a short summary of what we've accomplished here already, but with the loss of Scout Jyoba, I can't spare a runner to take the report to Denjai's base of Zabra'jin to the west.If you're headed that way, would you mind bringing this to him? Shadow Hunter Denjai can be a little intimidating at first, but once you get used to him, he's not so bad.",
