They now choose to worship only Azshara, their naga queen.  You will see likenesses of Azshara littered around their settlements, carved out of seastone.<The murloc spirit eyes your weapon.>That weapon will do.  Send it through their Azsh'ir idols.  They need to be reminded that our father Neptulon is the only one who truly rules the seas.",
