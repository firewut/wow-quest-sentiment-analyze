    "description": "Oru'kai was the first ogre mage to master the art of enchanting. Upon his death, his items were scattered across Draenor. I have tracked his scepter to the field you see before us. \r\n\r\nAs you can see, the scepter's enchantment is making it difficult to retrieve. A would-be apprentice, Torag Stonefury, took one of Oru'kai's rings in to break the enchantment, but he failed and became trapped in ice. \r\n\r\nFree Torag, take the ring, and complete his task, and I will consider a reward.",
