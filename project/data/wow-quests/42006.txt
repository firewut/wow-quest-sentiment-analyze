There are strange happenings in Coldarra, and it would be best to understand them before proceeding.\r\n\r\nDuring my last visit to Dragonblight, I sensed unusual energies from the Azure Dragonshrine. Since this place was integral to Malygos' plans during the Nexus War, whatever is there may explain the current state of the Nexus.\r\n\r\nHere, take this image crystal. I must remain in Dalarn on Kirin Tor business, so we will speak through it. Good luck.",
