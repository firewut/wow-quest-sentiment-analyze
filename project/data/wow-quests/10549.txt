By not so well I mean they killed him and shrunk his head.Now this might seem cold, calculating, and exceptionally callous, but he'd pay a lot to get his son's head back.  Sounds like the perfect job for you!Go east until you find the troll ruins of Zeb'Tela and Zeb'Nowa.  You're bound to find it one of the chests there.",
