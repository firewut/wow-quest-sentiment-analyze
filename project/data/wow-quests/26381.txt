While the apothecaries can make fine use of the god's venom, they are relatively inexperienced in ritual magic.Fortunately, I am quite familiar with preparing dark convocations. You will bring the scattered parts of Shadra to me, and I will help you bring her to this plane to be taken out.The first part is the eye of Shadra, guarded in Agol'watha to the north.",
