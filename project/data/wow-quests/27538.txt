I've got a tip that'll help your men here... and my bird!When water elementals carve their way through rock, they create a peculiar kind of muck. It dries hard as stone but carries with it the rejuvenating power of water. You make a cast out of that muck and broken bones knit together like iron.Bring some of that muck to Talaa, your shaman downstairs. She'll know what to do with it!",
