We must keep their defenses weak so that they do not also grow a spine.I have a plan that will do that and more.  I want you to traverse the bridge to the southwest, which crosses over Bloodmaul Ravine and leads into the Living Grove.Attack their fey drake defenses in the Living Grove and bring back the magical dust that sometimes can be found upon their wings.",
