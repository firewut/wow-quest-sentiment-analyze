Besides, this lovely little goblin was just telling me about some Scourge that are even closer by.So apparently there's this nerubian underlord named Ix'lar that has been trying to make a name for himself ever since the Lich King was slain.  He's set up a camp of undead to our north.Sure, Tyrosus wants us to kill banshees in Northdale.  We'll get to that.  But let's kill this nerubian first, while we're close!",
