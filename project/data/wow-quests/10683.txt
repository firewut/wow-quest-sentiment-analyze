They're in search of draenei artifacts, no doubt - Baa'ri was home to many Baa'ri relics before Gul'dan buried the town under a volcanic explosion.  We must use this opportunity to recover the Tablets of Baa'ri, an ancient text rumored to hold the secrets of the Temple of Karabor... a place you might know as the Black Temple.",
