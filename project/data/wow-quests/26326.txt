It's not a terrible leap of logic to assume they're acting by her will.Go out and meet the elementals in battle to the northwest. Work with Torunscar and Norsala to find a way to communicate with their leaders and seek out the World Pillar. We would prefer such be done peacefully, but we will do whatever we must to seal the rift.",
