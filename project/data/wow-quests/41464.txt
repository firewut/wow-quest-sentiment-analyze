My body resists me, but I will stop this.\r\n\r\n<He looks at you.> You will stop this.\r\n\r\nHere is a root of the corrupted World Tree Shaladrassil. It has somehow found its way out of the ground to this untouched place and already the Darkfiend satyrs are hard at work corrupting Suramar.\r\n\r\nStop them.
