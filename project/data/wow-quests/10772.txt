They've begun forming their armies at the Path of Conquest, located east of here - adjacent to Eclipse Point.I want you to travel to the Path of Conquest and assess the situation. Once you've done so, use this flare gun to signal a gryphon rider. One will swoop down from the sky to meet you. Tell 'em what you've discovered and they'll give you the next set of orders.",
