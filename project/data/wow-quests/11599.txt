Thing is... my brother's been dead for years.I sold everything I owned to come looking for Thassarian, only to be stonewalled by the local bureaucracy.  I've even been threatened with arrest if I keep snooping around.I need someone in the good graces of the higher-ups... someone like you.  If you can help me, I heard that William's stationed at the Farshire mine.",
