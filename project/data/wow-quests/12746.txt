That whole thing is full of Argent Dawn prisoners. Most of them were already dead by the time we arrived, but a few were still breathing.I was about to go in there and execute the rest of them, but I think you should have the honors. In particular, there's a real feisty draenei in there that I think you'll take great pleasure in executing.",
