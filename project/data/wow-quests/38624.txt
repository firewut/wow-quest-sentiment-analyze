I would ask one last favor of our new champion, though. \r\n\r\nThe dragon who guided you to me awaits his vengeance against the vrykul. Together I wish for you to show these Drekirjar what it means to cross the Thorignir. Be they Felskorn or not, their malice has caused suffering to my brood. Their toll must be paid in blood.\r\n\r\nSpeak to Vethir when you are ready.",
