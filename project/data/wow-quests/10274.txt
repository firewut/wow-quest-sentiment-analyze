    "description": "The nether dragons have the same ferocious temperament as their black dragon forbears, but there is something entirely alien about them. They hatch and mature rapidly, harnessing the strange energies that forged their kind in the destruction of Draenor.There is so much more I need to know about them, but I believe the powers may be of use to my own flight.
