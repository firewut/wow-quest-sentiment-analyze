But... in times like these when supplies are so important, we can use what they have.Enter the Coldtooth mine and bring me back their supplies.  That will help keep the Alliance in fighting shape, and remove much needed equipment from the Horde's warriors.Good luck, <name>.  The mine is to the distant south, deep in Horde territory.",
