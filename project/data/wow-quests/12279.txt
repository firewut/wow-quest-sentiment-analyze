I worried that Griselda and I were going to be all alone.I'm cooking up some food here for us, but Griselda'll have none of it.She's fond of the fish that live off the coast of the Eastwind Shore, to the east. Can't stand them myself, but she's always been a picky eater. Six good-sized fish ought to keep her happy for a while.Now, run... err... limp along, Joe. Wouldn't want to keep the girl waiting, would ya?",
