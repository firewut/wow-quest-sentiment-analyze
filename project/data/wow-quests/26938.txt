I am now giving you full control over her abilities, <name>.Roaming around the farm's outskirts, you should find several of the Forsaken that you just created.  I want you to use your val'kyr to gather at least five of them.  Once you have done so, take your newly-formed band of soldiers, bring them into Felstone's barn, and kill the beast inside.
