All this time and Stormglen's been left mostly intact.It's too bad the Forsaken are still working their way inland, but it'll make a fine place to rest our feet for a night or two.The other half of town is overrun with spiders, so I've asked the villagers to stay away from there.Perhaps you'd like to lend a hand in clearing the spiders out?  I'm certain our injured men and women will sleep more soundly if they know someone's keeping those eight-legged beasts at bay.",
