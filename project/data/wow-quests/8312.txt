I think you'd like this candy - it makes you turn into things both funny and scary!Each of the innkeepers in the big cities have candy they give for Hallow's End - talk to them and do the tricks they ask for!  Also, a troll named Kali Remik in Orgrimmar is handing out candy as well.  When you have all the candy, bring them back to me here!",
