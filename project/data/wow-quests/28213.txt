But if you can get her attention...Take the eartag and show it to Winna. If there's even a little, tiny bit of her left, maybe it'll get through. Maybe her regret for her poor lost kitty will come to the surface and she'll feel sorry just one more time, and come out of the slime!And then maybe you can kill her and stop the slime. Yay!",
