Sometimes I get a little jealous when other women come into town, as I'm a little insecure about my appearance.;My VERY good friend Thonk works in the guard tower on that cliff, just to the northwest of Razor Hill.  He said something about a river overflowing, lots of work to be done, and so on.  I wasn't really paying attention...
