The Scryer, you see, has trapped within it a creature of vast intelligence and its needs are, shall we say, quite eccentric.To appease the Scryer, you must kill orcs.  Specifically, they must be Shattered Hand orcs -- the Scryer demands their souls.Return to me when the souls are reaped.  You will find the orcs north, and south, and surrounding...
