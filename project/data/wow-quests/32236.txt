How's a girl supposed to get any work done with them gobbling up the miners AND the ore?!This seemed like a good opportunity to use my newest invention, Bug Off.

They hate it and it doesn't seem to have many long term side-effects for the miners!What could possibly go wrong?Take this handy sprayer and get to work!",
