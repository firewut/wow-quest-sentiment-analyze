Ever since they lost the one underneath Manaforge Ultris, this is where their sole supply of material for running the forges is coming from.Needless to say, it would be a boon for us to cripple their mining operation.  Perhaps we'd even be able to move in and take it over for ourselves?Whatever the case, I want you to go in there and deal with Foreman Sundown.  The mine is around the back of the island to the left.",
