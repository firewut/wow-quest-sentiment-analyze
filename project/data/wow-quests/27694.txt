We were sent here to guard this place, and were instead used to unleash the terrible powers within.I must beg you for the help only a mortal can give. You can be my hand within the temple; should I enter by myself, I risk being turned against my brothers as well.We shall make a pact. If you wish to help, first gather Atal'ai artifacts from the waters around the temple, and return them to me.",
