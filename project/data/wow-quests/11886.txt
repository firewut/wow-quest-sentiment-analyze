The origins of this holiday are steeped in the very powers those madmen revere; this cannot be coincidence. Go to the camp just south of the Blackfathom Deeps entrance, in the ruins, and see if the cultists will part with information - forcefully if need be. Use this beacon to summon a guide when you find it.",
