When he saw the cultists making camp at Deathspeaker's Watch, west of the tourney grounds, Kul gathered the aspirants for an attack.They were easily captured, and now Kul languishes in a cage on the platform in the camp. I am sure that the cult will sacrifice the prisoners unless we can rescue them. Any of those cultists could carry keys to the black cages. Find the keys and free Kul and the captive aspirants.\r\n",
