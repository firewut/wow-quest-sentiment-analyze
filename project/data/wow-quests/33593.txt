We met briefly back at $p's garrison. \r\n\r\nAnyway, like I told you, I have a fifth degree black hammer in engineering and I'm eager to serve. The more danger the better!\r\n\r\nYou just fire this old flare whenever you're in trouble and I'll be there, quick as a quark!\r\n\r\nHopefully,\r\n\r\nPenny>",
