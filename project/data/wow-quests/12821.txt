I sent a runner to set a teleporter up behind Garm--successfully I might add--and he returned to get the power cell it needs to function. It isn't working yet... which means the power cell didn't get there.I need you to look just on the other side of Garm's Bane for the power cell. When you find it, bring it farther east to Garm's Rise and activate the teleporter.",
