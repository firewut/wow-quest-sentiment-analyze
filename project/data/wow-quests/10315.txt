In all of my travels throughout the cosmos, I have never encountered beings so selfish.They continue to destroy the land around us with their manaforges, so let's see if we can put a dent in their operations across the bridge at Manaforge Ara.Their nethermancers channel energy to and from the blood gems to stabilize the flow of power.
