At the bottom of the watery trench below exists Scalder, an elemental of air and watery fury.Once she is defeated, use the conch upon her remains to capture her magical steam. Return the full conch to me, and I'll imbue my knowledge of the Winterfin tongue into you.Luckily, a friend taught me a water breathing spell, which I will cast upon you.",
