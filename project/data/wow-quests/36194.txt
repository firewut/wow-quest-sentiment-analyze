    "description": "Incredible news, Commander <name>. Your ever-loyal servant has managed to secure us commandojacks. Now maybe you don't know what a commandojack is, so let me explain: they're like lumberjacks, only highly trained in the art of killing. Mostly they're out of work mercenaries and assassins.What this means is that we can now cut medium sized timber - but first we need to give these commandojacks a test run.There's a suitable tree nearby. Good luck!",
