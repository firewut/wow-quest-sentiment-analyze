I set down my sword for like ONE SECOND to gather some orbs, and a big sprite sprung out of nowhere, snatched it, and bounded off down the western gap.I can't go back to camp without it. Losing your weapon is a sure way to get kicked out of the Shado-Pan. It's sacred.Please, can you try to find this big sprite and get my sword back? It would mean a lot to me.",
