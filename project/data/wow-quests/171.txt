Thank you.I wish all the orphans were lucky enough to get to do the stuff we did. Do you think we could find Craggle Wobbletop again and get a foam sword rack from him? I think he's still pushing that cart in the Canals outside the Trade District. That way, everyone else at the orphanage could do something fun too!After that, it'll be time for me to go home.",
