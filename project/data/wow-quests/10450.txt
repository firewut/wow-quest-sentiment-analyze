Kill Bonechewer orcs and collect their vile blood.  There is an apothecary who needs the blood for her tests, so we can discover how these orcs fell to the demon taint, a taint from which we so recently freed ourselves.Bonechewers scavenge near the ruined battlements along the Path of Glory, to the south.
