    "description": "This battered, mud-stained journal has seen better days. Leafing through the pages, you discover dozens of notes, diagrams, and maps in the dwarven language.The only text you're able to decipher is the name of Brann Bronzebeard scrawled at the end of one of the entries.The back half of the book, containing the most recent entries, has been torn away. Someone thought the notes important enough to attempt to destroy them. Perhaps gathering the missing pages from the battlefield will yield some clues.",
