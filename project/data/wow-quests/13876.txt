The demon-tainted thing ensorcelled the entire tribe and our redemption was barely delivered by a druid known as Broll Bearmantle.But this time, we did not steal. The trolls of Zoram'gar gave us the charms as a sign of friendship. A deadly friendship it would seem.Our chief, Dal Bloodclaw, is too far gone. Enter the hold and return with his charms.",
