Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.\"My name's Oglethorpe Obnoticus, and my homing robot has crashed!  I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot!\"\"I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it crashed at the head of the river near Skulk Rock!\"",
