Dragons have taken up stinking residence within the hallowed halls of Blackrock Spire!These great wyrms hold a distressed damsel in their scaly graspers. Her name is Zaela, they say. Such a beautiful name!As my squire, it is your Light-given duty to adventure yourself into this spire and procure evidence of these dragons, lest I waste my heroism on a dragonless quest.",
