I don't suppose I could persuade you to help with one of the dishes, could I?Turkey is hard to come by here, so if you could supply some slow-roasted turkeys, it would be a big help. If you intend to prepare them yourself, you can hunt fresh wild turkeys anywhere in the Tirisfal Glades. You should be able to buy everything else you need from any of the Pilgrim's Bounty vendors.",
