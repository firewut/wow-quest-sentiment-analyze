I do not know what we may gain from this venture, but there is one task I must set for you.\r\n\r\nAdvisor Melandrus once called himself my ally. He and I planned Elisande's downfall, but when the moment came I found myself betrayed.\r\n\r\nThe wound his dagger inflicted still aches. I cannot enter Suramar to take my revenge, but you can.\r\n\r\nGive him a traitor's death, and bring me his spellstone.",
