You see, I'd been meaning to marry her for months!I had it all planned out.  I was going to propose the very night of the shipwreck... but now the ring is gone.  I've searched everywhere!I know it might sound crazy, but I know the engagement ring is in the Basin.  If some Venture Company didn't steal it, maybe a wild creature ate it.
