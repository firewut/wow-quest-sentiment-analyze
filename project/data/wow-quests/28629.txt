If you promise not to tell, I'll let you in on the secret... I'm going to make a mechanical yeti! Not only are my friends sure to be freaked out when they see it, but when they get over that, I know they'll be impressed!I need thick yeti fur from the Ice Thistle yeti. There's plenty of them in the Ice Thistle Hills to the southeast.",
