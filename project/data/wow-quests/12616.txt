There is a new power lurking within, one that answers neither to the Guardian's magic nor the Legion. From what they've scouted, it appears it is an elven prince called Tenris Mirkblood, and there is reason to believe he serves the Scourge.Go, my friend, investigate Mirkblood's chamber, and return with any information you might find.",
