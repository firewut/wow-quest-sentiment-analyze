Now, let us hope your fortune holds, for I have a dire task to ask of you...Warlord Morkh sits within the barracks of Zeth'Gor, commanding his fel troops against us.  His tactics are as clever as they are cruel, and I must admit that his successes against us have cut deep.  And so, <name>, I ask you to remove Morkh from his seat.  Bring me his armor so that we might display it for our soldiers and bolster them.",
