They'll do anything to stop the return of Goldrinn.This \"Lycanthoth\" is a twisted version of our beloved wolf god, summoned by the Twilight's Hammer to replace him.Bah! It is but a shadow of Goldrinn's power. <name>, kill this beast so that the true ancient can return. Take this incense and burn it in the Maw of Lycanthoth east of here. Slay that beast and free Goldrinn!",
