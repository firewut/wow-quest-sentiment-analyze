Our Coilskar forces are waiting at the Black Temple on the other side.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I wouldn't have chosen to bring our naga allies. But, their leader did swear fealty to Lord Illidan. I suppose we'll see.\r\n\r\nWe'll have to find a way to power the gateway's activator. Like this last gateway, it runs on souls.\r\n\r\n<Allari the Souleater grins as Sevis says this.>",
