As I went out to pet one of the little fawns a ravenous mountain cat leapt out and killed it. I fled to Tarren Mill and swore to solve the plight of the hill fawn. Now, after many days of tinkering, I have created the hill fawn's salvation!Take my wand into the fields to the west and use it to empower the wee hill fawns. Once empowered they will be able to fend for themselves!",
