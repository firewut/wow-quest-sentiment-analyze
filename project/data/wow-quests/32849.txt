Dippy's not the most accomplished challenger in the Brawler's Guild, but he's no pushover, either!Actually, come to think of it, he IS kind of a pushover...Anyway! The card you've earned gives you the right to challenge Dippy alongside his older, huger brother, Doopy. They may both be pushovers, but that doesn't mean that one or both of them won't eventually murder you.",
