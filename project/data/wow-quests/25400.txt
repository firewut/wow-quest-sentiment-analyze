He has, however, told me that the ruins of the High Wilderness to the south are full of Gordunni ogres.The ogres are not only a threat, they're destroying any forest and wildlife nearby. Estulan has also warned me of what might happen if they discover any artifacts of Highborne power among the ruins...Head south, <name>, and slay any Gordunni you find!",
