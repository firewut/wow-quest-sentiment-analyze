One of our sages, Highmesa, has foolishly gone north with only one longrunner to investigate something strange near the Dens of Dying.What are the dens, you ask? They are a sacred place to the magnataur, where they go in their old age to die. She saw something fall from the sky near them a few days ago.If you would be friend to the taunka, I would have you find and help her. She is not so stubborn that she will not accept your aid.",
