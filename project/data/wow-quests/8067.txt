    "description": "We Zandalar prize what we wear as a symbol of accomplishment.  You don't need to be able to see what one wears to be able to sense what emanates from it - power transcends sight.  The garments of the Zandalar predator are like this, and most cherished by them is the mantle they wear.  It helps to obfuscate them from view... and to make their presence known when they wish it.The Paragons of Power await your retrieval in Zul'Gurub.  Bring me what I seek, and the predator's mantle shall be yours.",
