Helm's Bed Lake, to the south, used to be beautiful and tranquil, but it is now overrun with agitated water elementals. When they started to leave the confines of the lake, I sent my troops in to keep them busy, but most have been frozen in blocks of ice.If we can break them free, they have a good chance of recovering.
