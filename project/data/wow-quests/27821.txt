Redridge, Duskwood, even Elwynn itself are all a day's march from here.We've made the first strike, and I don't plan to give the Horde a chance to catch their breath. So consider yourself deployed. Grab a weapon, join the rest of the troops out in the Bloodmire, and start killing orcs.Report back here after you've done some damage. I want you back alive...and that's an order. Dismissed!",
