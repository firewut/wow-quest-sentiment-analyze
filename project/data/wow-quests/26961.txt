But we didn't have the chance to study them, for soon after their discovery the troggs chased us away from the ruins! And those idols have a strange effect on the troggs. It makes them go berserk!Bring me 8 idols - I want to study them, and I want them out of trogg hands!  You can find the idols on the troggs infesting the site.",
