One elf in particular garnered my favor.Arch-Druid Glaidalis is his name. He now resides in the forest known as the Darkheart Thicket, plotting to undo this world with this awful blight.Before his betrayal, I gave him my book of enchantments to study. I would very much like it back.I trust you with this task, enchanter. Bring my book back to me.",
