I believe this brew can coax some helpful information out of Shan Kien.I am needed here, so I have no choice but to ask you to recover the essential ingredient for me. We need the spirit essence of a mogu that lived in the time of the memory we wish to see.You should be able to find just such a spirit inside the Path of Conquerors, to the northeast.",
