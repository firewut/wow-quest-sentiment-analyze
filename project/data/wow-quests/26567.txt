If anyone can stop the Blackrock orc invasion, it's JOHN J. KEESHAN. We need to get him to help us or Lakeshire will be nothing more than a mound of rubble and ash after that massive Blackrock army marches through to Elwynn.I heard he was fighting in the underground fight club at the Lakeshire inn. Find him and tell him everything you know.",
