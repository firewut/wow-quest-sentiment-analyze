Those phials don't grow on trees!  Actually, I wish they did, because I'd go there and pick one off since I don't have another one!!in order to make you one, I need the following: a mana potion, a piece of coal, and some sweet nectar.  Don't ask why, just bring me what I ask and I'll make you a new one.",
