This must be why the Winterfall protect the hot springs so fervently -- they need them to purify their firewater.We need to stop this -- cut off contact between the Winterfall and the Deadwood. A group of runners walks the distance between their village and Felwood. Find and defeat them, and steal their shipment.",
