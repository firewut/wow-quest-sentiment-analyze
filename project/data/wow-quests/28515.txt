I've been meaning to visit a friend in Burning Steppes for the last several months, but haven't had the chance.His name is Mouton Flamestar.  While he's not a member of the Brotherhood, he's a trusted friend, and definitely trustworthy.Will you send him my regards?  You'll have to travel south, through the base of Blackrock Mountain.  Just keep heading south... you'll find him.Thank you.",
