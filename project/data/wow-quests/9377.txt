    "description": "Falcon Watch serves as a stop for pilgrims on their long journey into Outland. Although we are an early stop on the way, many of the pilgrims reach us exhausted and wracked by their addictions.In a world such as this, many find it necessary to relearn mastery of their magical addiction. Food and drink help, <class>, but magical energy is their greatest need. The remains of Outland's voidwalkers provide a potent source of energy, but they grow rare and can only be found in the Warp Fields to the southwest.",
