    "description": "Hard to believe that most people fish in the Dalaran Sewers for giant rats and mutated fish.  Especially when those waters are filled with priceless jewelry - discarded by broken hearted fools, thieves, and careless drunks.The trick is to let your hook drag the bottom and don't pull up too hard when you get something.
