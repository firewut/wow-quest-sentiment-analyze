That would explain the dangerous-looking fellow who crossed into this realm shortly before you.Not everyone handles the transition as... gracefully as you did. The oaf is still grappling with his own mind, stumbling about and muttering nonsense.Soon he will be drawn to the orb again, which would presumably lead him to Veil Terokk.Better to take him out now while he's still befuddled.",
