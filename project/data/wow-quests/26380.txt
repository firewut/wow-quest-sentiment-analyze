As I was leaving town, I was attacked by a Frostmane troll raiding party. It's going to take me days to repair the wagon!I don't suppose you'd be willing to do me a favor, will you? These big kegs aren't going anywhere, but I have some smaller sample casks. Would you bring them to Kharanos for me? Just follow the road to the southeast.",
