Quite the clever one, for a quilboar.I've been tryin' to think what got these quilboar riled up so much recently, and it might be that Mangletooth escaped Taurajo alive. If he has, he's certainly calling the shots.There's a large hut up in the hills to the northwest. If you find Mangletooth there, cut 'im down.",
