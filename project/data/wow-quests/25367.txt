If they are driving the gnolls to frenzy against us, then they are as big of a threat - if not more - than the gnolls.Dive deep into where these Zukk'ash insects dwell; it is known as the Writhing Deep.  Thin their numbers and report back to me what you find, bringing back their carapaces as evidence of your handiwork.",
