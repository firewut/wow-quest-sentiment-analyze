That doesn't prevent me from appreciating a fellow craftsman's work, <name>.I've come across pieces of Amani weaponry and I must admit I'm impressed by the quality of their work.  It is rumored that Spearcrafter Otembe wields a magical hammer that is so light and well-balanced it allows him to work with great dexterity and efficiency.If you bring me this tool I'll use it to craft you a weapon.",
