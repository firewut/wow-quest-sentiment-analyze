The usher will take us to the top of the rise.  Once there, you will help me defeat Razelikh, for I fear I am not strong enough to defeat him alone.Most importantly, I need you to hold the stone knife, and do not use it until I tell you to.  The knife will trap Razelikh's soul within its new, eternal prison.If we succeed, speak with Grimeo, the draenei.",
