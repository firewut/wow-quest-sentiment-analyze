Boktar may be in command, but no one tells a hunter what to do.'Put that beast away,' he says. 'Make it stop growling.'All of a sudden he changes his mind when it suits him. Next time he complains, Frostbite'll just nip him a bit. Don't worry, she'll do an admirable job tracking your prey. After she locates her target, you're on your own to deal with iron dwarves, or Brann, or whatever you find.",
