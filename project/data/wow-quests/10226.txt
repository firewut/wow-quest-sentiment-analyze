I'm not certain exactly what this power will do, but I know that I can use it.The sundered rumblers and warp aberrations on the ledge of the Crumbling Wastes to the south have just what I need for the engines!The extractor will change the form of their power into something solid that you'll be able to gather up after you've defeated them.",
