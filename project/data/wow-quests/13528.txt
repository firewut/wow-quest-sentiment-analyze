It's actually good news that the crabs appear to have caught this from the bears - hopefully that means this all stems from one source. We need to focus our attention on those bears now.Buzzbox 723 is near the waterfalls to the east. It's going to be messy work, but it's necessary - I'll need you to bring some fresh bear guts to that buzzbox for analysis. We'll go from there once I have the information.",
