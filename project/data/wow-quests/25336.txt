I'll help you set on the path to make some, and you'll give me the chance to practice my craft.This vessel can shrink and trap a defeated creature inside of it. We'll need the muisek of beasts first; ironfur bears and longtooth wolves. Kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them before their spirits can escape.",
