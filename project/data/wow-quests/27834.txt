My sword bites like a crocolisk, and my arrows sing like banshees.  I tend to wear down quickly, however, and can't take as much punishment as either of my two brothers.You give the word, and I'll send an aimed shot right through your target's heart.  I can also cheer my brothers on, sending 'em into a battle-fueled frenzy.Why don't we go try fighting together?",
