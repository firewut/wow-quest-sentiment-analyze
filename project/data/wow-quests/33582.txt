Kuuan was supposed to cover for me, but instead he sold me out to gain favor with our superiors.They plucked my eyes, broke my wings, and threw me off the spire.Yet I am the fortunate one, for if Iskar hadn't found me, I'd have died there. And now Kuuan shows his face in Veil Shadar on the same day that you show up willing to kill for coin. Fortunate, indeed.",
