    "description": "Greetings, Highlord. I have important news to share with you.During my expedition to the Broken Shore, I saw with my own eyes an extraordinarily luminescent object emerge from the Felstorm. It fell down towards the coast of Suramar, cutting a swath through the tempest itself!From it I felt an incredible surge of power, before it vanished beyond the horizon.We need to bring news of this immediately to Archmage Khadgar.",
