Yet we know very little about these enigmatic creatures.  I have received news that northwest of here in Shattrath City there are arakkoa who are not hostile.  They might be willing to share the secrets of their race.  Rilak the Redeemed is their leader.  He resides in the northern part of the Lower City.",
