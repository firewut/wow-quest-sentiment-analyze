Only a few veteran guards remain unaccounted for.The scouts have done all we can here. You must pick up where we've left off.Sounds of a skirmish are coming from up the hill to the northeast. Have a look, <class>. We can only hope there are some who have survived, and that they may have some intel we can use against this enemy.",
