    "description": "Alora and I were were able to escape through one of the Legion's portals back to Azeroth but that's about as far as our luck got us.The portal put us on a small isle somewhere to the west of the Broken Shore. They saw us quickly and we made a run for the protection of the water. As I attempted to leap to safety, I was wounded. But Alora... she tripped and I watched them drag her back.Rescue her, please! I'll mark where the camp is on your map, just don't let her go through that ordeal again.",
