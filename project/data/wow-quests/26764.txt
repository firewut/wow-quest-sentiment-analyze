Not one to miss out an opportunity for profit, their foreman has enslaved druids, and is forcing them to re-grow the forest so they can chop it down again!Personally, I find this abhorrent, and not just because I didn't think of it first.Release a few of these druids from their captors.  I'm sure they'll appreciate it.",
