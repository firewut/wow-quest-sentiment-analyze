Take them off of their lice-ridden birds and they're nothing.Even you can slay them easily, Horde-<class>.Hunt gryphon riders flying over the river north of Bloodgulch. Take this hook and fling it at them as they fly by. Their momentum will hurl them from their mount, right to your feet. Finish them! Kill a few Thundermar gryphon riders and I'll believe your Horde is as mighty as you say.",
