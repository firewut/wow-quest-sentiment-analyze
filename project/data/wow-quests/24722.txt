They came without warning, and took no prisoners.  They were lucky that so many of them survived.A few weeks ago, I came across a crystal pylon in the cliffs to the northeast of here, east of Marshal's Refuge.  I think the pylon and the attacks may be related somehow.  Maybe you can investigate?  I'm sure someone in Marshal's Stand will thank you.",
