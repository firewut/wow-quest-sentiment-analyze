He said that it sits in the middle of time, and is really important for keeping things straight.I don't know what that means, but he said that there were dragons there that were helping to save the world!  I want to see a dragon!I think we should go there.  He said that the entrance was on the eastern edge of a great desert named Tanaris.You could buy me a souvenir while we're there!",
