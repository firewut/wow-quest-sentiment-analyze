They smashed my ship, killed my crew, and set me on a lifeboat to Booty Bay.  I will not rest until their corpses pepper the ocean floor!One of the giants, Gorlash, stole my captain's chest.  I hear Gorlash wanders the coast east of here.  Find him and get back my chest!  Do that, and you'll have earned a captain's gratitude.",
