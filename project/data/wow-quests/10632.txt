I, however, do not have the luxury of indulging in my 'personal' interests.If you want to make a difference around here, you'll do what I ask of you, and right now, I need weapons.Our guns are effective at range, but when the bugs get in close, we need to have powerful melee weapons as a backup.The teeth of the daggermaw lashtails in the northern part of the Razor Ridge make for great vibro-weapon blades.
