But it is my firm belief that each visitor to this island should honor those who have sacrificed all so that they may continue to do so.Dath'Remar Sunstrider was our first king.  He led us here from Kalimdor through the Maelstrom.Seek out his shrine to the west and do not return to me until you have read the plaque upon it in his honor.",
