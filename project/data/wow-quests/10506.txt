Unfortunately there's another source nearby.The Bloodmaul ogres in the ravine below to the east keep a strong pack as their own sentries.  I hated sending you to kill the Thunderlord wolves, so why don't we do something different this time?I've derived a magic powder from the dust that naturally falls off the wings of our fey drakes.  Sprinkle it on the Bloodmaul dire wolves to make them undesirable to the Horde.",
