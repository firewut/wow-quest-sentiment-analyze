They seem to be confused... maybe a little frightened.Something happened that we're not seeing here, <name>.  I say we do some investigation before we just kill every troll in sight.There are three troll camps in the area: one to the southeast, one to the southwest, and one due west.  Each camp has a soothsayer... see if you can get close enough to listen to what they're saying.",
