We didn't stop the Horde from advancing into the continent. \r\n\r\nBut I think I've found a way to get the locals on our side. You just helped fight off some of these \"yaungol\", no?\r\n\r\nI hear yaungol sacked Westwind Rest, a local village. We've been told that two groups of survivors have camped out along the road west out of town.\r\n\r\nWe help them out, maybe they'll consider siding with the Allliance.",
