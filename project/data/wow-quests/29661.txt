In the meantime, you would benefit from practice and discipline.Your first task is the task of all trainees entering the pools: cross the balance poles to the west and ring the bell without falling into the pool.Should you fall, the pool's curse will make it difficult to get on a pole again, so you will need to return to the edge of the pool to start over.Oh, and beware the cranes.",
