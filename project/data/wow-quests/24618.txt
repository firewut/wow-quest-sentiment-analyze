It is little more than a line in the sand, but it must be OUR line.In the center of the scar you will find a flag marker designating who controls it. Scout out the flag.If it's not already ours, capture it for the Horde - it will swing the battle in our favor. Investigate the scar and kill anyone you find in there!",
