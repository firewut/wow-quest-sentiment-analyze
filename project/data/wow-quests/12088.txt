We think he went off north to the Wailing Ziggurat.  If we hadn't fought side by side by him we'd even think he was a traitor.See, he's a Death Knight... and I know they're on our side and all... but it wasn't too long ago they were servants of Arthas.But not Thassarian, he's a good guy.  Go to the Wailing Ziggurat, see if he's doing okay.",
