I wouldn't recommend getting close to them unless you're prepared for combat.They have no fear of us and won't hesitate to defend their territory.It's fitting that such a creature would have a magnificent tail. I've been trying to collect enough of them to trim a new cloak, but the worgs have a habit of evading my snares. Will you help?",
