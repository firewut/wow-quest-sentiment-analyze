They have forgotten more about crazy old gods, ancient legends and lore than most scholars will ever know.Lucky for you, I know someone in the Earthen Ring here in Ashenvale.  Head over to Zoram'gar Outpost on the coast of the Zoram Strand; show Je'neu Sancrea what you found.  If anyone can figure out that globe's significance, it'd be him.",
