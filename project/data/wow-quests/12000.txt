It was also a powerful ley line nexus.The blue dragonflight used a magical device they call a surge needle to destroy that nexus, freeing the power to redirect at their will.I need more information and I hope that you will get it for me.After the upheaval at the ruins, the ghosts of the Highborne rose up and decimated half of the mage hunters present.
