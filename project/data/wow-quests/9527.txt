You can imagine my surprise when they stormed the beach and attacked us.I fought tooth and nail but was easily overpowered. As I blacked out from the vicious blows that I had been dealt, I prayed that my family not suffer.When I awoke, all was quiet. The sand was soaked red with blood - their blood. They were devoured whole.I care not for vengeance, <name>. I only ask that their remains be returned to me for proper burial.",
