Now it's all we can do to keep from being attacked by our own creations!I'm going to offer you a chance to receive a magical boon in exchange for some collecting work on your part.  Bring me a stack of arcane slivers that are found on the mana-using creatures of Sunstrider Isle, and I will cast a spell on you that should aid your adventures on the isle.",
