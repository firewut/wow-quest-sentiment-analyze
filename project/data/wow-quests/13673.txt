    "description": "Some of the champions believe an ancient weapon born of Northrend will bring them luck in the tourney. I have agreed to help them search for these weapons.There's an old legend from Grizzly Hills about a maiden cursed with a frog's form to protect the blade she has long guarded. She lives among the lake frogs on the shore of Ashwood Lake, just east of Ashwood Post. The only thing said to break the curse is a kiss, freely given. Apply this balm before kissing anything, <name>. Otherwise, you'll catch warts.",
