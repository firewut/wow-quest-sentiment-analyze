    "description": "Greetings, friend. I have been told that you are in need of a master of beasts. I come from the icy slopes of Northrend to finally shake this snow from my fur.This savage land holds many creatures that we may tame so that our forces may ride on formidable war mounts. The mighty clefthoof reminds me of the mammoths from my home. Take this lasso and head out to the northern reaches of Frostfire Ridge. Mount up and use it to capture one of the young beasts.",
