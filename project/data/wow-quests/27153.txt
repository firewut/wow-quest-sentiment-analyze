Those belong to the Argent Crusade.Gnolls are known for thievery, but as far as I know, Hearthglen hasn't had any incursions since the Redpine came.  Very suspicious.I know a few helpful folks within Hearthglen: Morris Vant, Outfitter Mendelev, Bree Ironstock, and High Cleric Alphus.  All can be trusted, and are well-connected.  Question them, to find out if they know anything about these lost supplies.",
