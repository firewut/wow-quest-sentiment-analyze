Take this training collar and enter the wilds of this valley. Locate the Alterac rams that roam throughout the area and use the collar to snare one. When you have captured a ram, return it to me and I shall place it in our stable.When we have enough rams, the ram rider commander will be notifed. With your help, the cavalry will be reborn!",
