The poor souls were victims of a tragic incident in which scores of them drowned at the bottom of the lake.The details of the event are mostly forgotten, but their haunting cries serve as a constant reminder of their curse.If you're up to the task, I want you to go to the lake and put an end to their suffering, <name>.  You will have my gratitude as well as theirs... I'm sure.",
