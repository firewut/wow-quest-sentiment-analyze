It's become a real problem for the lotus farmers.Coincidentally, I make a jam out of gelatinous toadspawn. I call it \"Bottletoads\" and it's a big hit with the kids around here. Can't keep any in stock.If you're heading to the pools, you'd be doing everyone a favor by uh... liberating some of those toad eggs.Into this bottle.
