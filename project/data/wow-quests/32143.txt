I would like to use your services to test my latest \"Siege-o-Matic\", a device of terrible and varied abilities.I promise it is mostly harmless to its users.When you are around Domination Point be on the look out for my Scout-o-Meters. They have been dispatched to get info on good siege targets. When you find one, activate it and I will pilot a Siege-o-Matic to your location.See you in the field... as it were.",
