    "description": "The dire wolves are the most common threat to the townsfolk here. They lurk in the forests on all sides of us, though most are along the north bank of the river.These aren't the runt dogs you see in Elwynn, or wherever you come from. They're big as a man and twice as vicious.If you wish to assist the people of Darkshire, hunt the dire wolves so our streets can be safer.",
