I've just the task for you... something that'll take you far away from here.We've long sought to gain the favor of the tuskarr native to Northrend.  Recently a young tuskarr came to us seeking help, something we couldn't offer at the time.Now that you're around, maybe you can lend him a hand.  Look for Karuk near the Riplash Strand, southwest of here, and see what you can do to help.  ",
