Our enemies are many and our resources are few. Please, <name>, perhaps you will hear me if the council will not. Speak to Gryth Thurden, Ironforge's gryphon master. He's in the eastern part of the Great Forge. He'll provide a free flight to the South Gate Pass. Introduce yourself to Pilot Hammerfoot once you arrive.",
