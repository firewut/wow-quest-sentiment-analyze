Our particular excursion is focused on the demonic artifacts that are hidden in what used to be the Tainted Scar.A worgen druid has taken residence in the scar and is coaxing a forest to grow.  He seems to be failing, however, as the area is still infested with demons.Anyhow, his forest stands in the way of our excursion, as do these demons.  Slay the tainted ones, then return to me so we might deal with the druid.",
