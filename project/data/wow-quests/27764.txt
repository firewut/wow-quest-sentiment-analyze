I have a package that I need delivered.A young lady came by our town not long ago, looking for compressed blasting powder, a tempered mithril bomb casing, and some safety goggles.  Naturally, we had plenty of blasting powder and bomb casings to sell her, but the safety goggles were a little harder to find.Long story short, I've got the goggles, but she's already returned to her studies down in Lethlor Ravine.  Will you bring these down to her?",
