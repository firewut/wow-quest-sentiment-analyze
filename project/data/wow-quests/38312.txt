That may prove problematic.\r\n\r\nThe only way I see up the mountain is through that vrykul city, and the gates are shut tight. We should be able to grapple over, though. If you don't have a launcher, I managed to wrangle a spare from one of these vrykul.\r\n\r\nI'll scout ahead and see if I can find a good spot to get in.",
