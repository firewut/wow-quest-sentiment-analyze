Backing up their legions are hordes of fire elementals bound to the service of the firelord, Ragnaros.If we can free those elementals from their bonds, we can both weaken our enemies and honor the elements. Take this totem with you and use it on subdued fireguards. It will free their spirits from their bondage and restore them to their natural state.",
