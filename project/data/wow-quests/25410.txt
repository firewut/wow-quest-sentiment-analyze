Most of them haven't seen an entire defensive line scattered by what they thought was cover.And have you ever seen a peon try to chop one down and get surprised? I was in tears...At any rate, they're immensely valuable allies. You'll find some wandering just outside  the Tower of Estulan and more in forest to the east, just southeast of Dire Maul. Be on the lookout for the Horde!",
