    "description": "Arnold and I have been fishing in and around Stormwind for years now.  That's the kind of time it takes to find a good fishing spot.  One of my favorites is called Thunder Falls.It's just south of Stormwind in Elwynn Forest.  Best part about Thunder Falls is the violet perch.  I have never seen them anywhere else, only up there at the falls.  It's a bit of hike for me and Arnold to get out there these days though, do you think you could head up there and fetch some of those perch for us?",
