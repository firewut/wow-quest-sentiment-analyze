    "description": "When the dreadfang widows attacked our outpost we heard the voice of the naaru calling us to battle.  We pursued the creatures into the night.  Some of our people we found dead in the dark, others we could hear struggling against their captors. By morning we had come to this place and we fought a fierce battle but we were beaten.  Dreadfang poison will soon take my companions and I cannot last long.  Before I die I must know that the dreadfang widows were beaten.",
