They came from nowhere, dark wizards with magical beasts - I was surrounded!A magical box appeared above me, opened up and pulled me inside. Just as it began to close around me, my rescuers swooped in on the backs of red drakes. It was breathtaking!I never thanked them for saving me. Please, <class>, find them, and pass on my gratitude.",
