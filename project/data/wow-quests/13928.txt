So far we've been able to repel the Horde, but now they're going around us to directly attack the retreat to the north.The keeper sent out his dryads to defend the tree, but they do not seem to be much of a match for the vanguard of the Warsong orcs.I need you to go out there and recover as many laughing sister corpses as you can. Take them to Halannia inside the tree at the retreat. She will know what to do.",
