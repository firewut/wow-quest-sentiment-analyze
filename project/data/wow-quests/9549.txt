    "description": "My observations and writings about the Blacksilt murlocs are quite illuminating, <name>, but they are just the beginning. I plan to return to Ironforge with items produced by the Blacksilts' rudimentary crafting skills.The problem is that the Blacksilt carry these items with them at all times, and I can't have their blood on my conscience. If you're willing to help me gather the idols carried by Blacksilt seers and crude knives of the Blacksilt warriors and shorestrikers, I won't ask how you came by them.",
