I've fought tooth and nail for Silvermoon to be allowed a place beside Undercity and Orgrimmar at the negotiating table.This should silence any opposition. Take this letter to the Saurfang in Orgrimmar.  As leader of the orcs he must have a say in accepting the sin'dorei's pledge.I've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement.
