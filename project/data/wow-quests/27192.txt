King Terenas, Uther the Lightbringer, Highlord Fordring...yes, they all enjoyed Siabi's specialty.Sadly, Fras stayed in his shop when Stratholme was invaded, swearing on his life that the Scourge would never touch his tobacco. Venture forth and see if even one bit remains here...it is worth its weight in gold, I assure you.",
