I made a deal, however...We will wait.  We attack Koltira and his troops when the time is right.  In the meantime, speak with Ginny Goodwin and take a flight to the Chillwind Camp, to our south.  Commander Ashlam Valorfist will give you your next assignment.You will hear from me when you are needed again in Andorhal.",
