I have brothers who are falling in the battle overhead and if we do not act quickly, they will only bolster the emberwyrm ranks.Get into the shrine through the pass in the south... the Scourge presence should be lighter there.Search the shrine for ruby acorns that have fallen from the tree and plant them near the bodies of my fallen brood. Through this, they can give new life... a proud fate for any of my kind.",
