You see, sometimes in order to understand how something comes into being, you have to work backwards.I've recently heard of the corruption of one of our greatest gods, Cenarius. I have no doubt the same corruption that lives in these herbs also resides within him now.If you were able to cleanse that corruption, find a way to understand how it works and remove it, I think we can apply that to how we harvest these herbs.",
