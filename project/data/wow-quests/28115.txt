    "description": "Bears are soulless beasts put upon this earth to torment us. Only through Forsaken ingenuity have we devised a way to make use of the bears so that they may serve some purpose! We use the bears at our spider farm as living egg feeders. Our spiders lay their eggs in the bear flesh and the eggs thrive off of the meat and blood of the beasts.After they have served their purpose the monsters must be put down. Travel southeast and kill the infested bears that have lived past their prime.",
