I'd hate to know what happened to me armor but I hope its still usable.I'll need a wee bit to recover from me wounds and without my stuff I'm no help in a fight. Could ye go find my gear for me?Last I saw my armors in a chest next to that big tower south of here, my dagger was to the south west, and my mace over near that lava field to the west.",
