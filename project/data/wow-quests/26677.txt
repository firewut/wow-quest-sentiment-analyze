In fact, just yesterday a pack of ghouls was pounding on the walls of my tower!I want to make an effigy - a kind of \"scarecrow\" for ghouls.  To do that I need some ghoul ribs.  You can find plenty of them on the fetid corpses wandering Manor Mistmantle's grounds, north of Darkshire...Get the ribs for me, and I will repay you with some coin.",
