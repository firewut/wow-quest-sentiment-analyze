It is said this vision--and the feeling of elation it brings--is a reward to the mind for working the body.There IS an easier way, though we rarely resort to it anymore: a tea can be brewed using lotus root and dreamleaf, which grows around the shrine on the upper tier.Bring the dreamleaf to Yan back in town and he can brew the tea for you.",
