I have a plan to keep Wishock \"preoccupied,\" but I'll need your help. There is a flower growing in the Garden of Stalvan on the outskirts of Darkshire.  This small white flower is known as the Tear of Tilloa.  I will also need a Musquash Root, found only at the very base of the falls far beneath the Stonewrought Dam in the Wetlands.",
