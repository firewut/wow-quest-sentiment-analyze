Already it is... unspeakable.Nevertheless, to forsake your friends out of spite would be against our way. Any that yet live are doubtlessly wounded and in desperate need of care.These fireworks were to celebrate the statue's completion. Use them near your companions to signal Mishi, and she will bear them off to safety.",
