Spirits or not, the Ango'rosh are not different.Even with their ritual books, they won't relinquish their power to you until you prove yourself.I've fought ogres my entire life, and there's only one way to earn that.Killing them outright.The more Ango'rosh spirits and their pets as you take out while you're there, the more respect you'll command among them.",
