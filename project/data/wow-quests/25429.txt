Our scouts have discovered what appears to be a hive nearby, extending deep beneath the ground.The insects of the hive are large and ferocious, and most likely pose an even greater threat than the gnolls. I want you to proceed to the hive with caution. Cut down a good portion of the bugs and bring back their carapaces for further study.",
