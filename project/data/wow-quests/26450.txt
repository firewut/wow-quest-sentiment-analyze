They tend to keep little statues lying around on their shrines, in the sand, under their trees.  They don't seem to be USING them.I could use those statues!  I could... put 'em around the camp, make it feel a little more homey.  Anything's better than a bloody dinosaur corpsepump.  I could sell them as souvenirs.I could sell them back to the naga!Why don't you go grab a couple while I figure this out.",
