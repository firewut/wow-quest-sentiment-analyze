Tribal elders could no longer hold his rage in check.Now he has all but parted ways with the Horde. He's gone rogue, <name>, and seeks to lash out at the Alliance with a small band of like-minded partisans.If you, too, seek vengeance, you will find him southeast of here, at the foot of Bael Modan.",
