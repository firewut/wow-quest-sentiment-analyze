We were charged by the Titans themselves to protect the world.Once I gave up on the post of Prime Designate, I gave up any measure of influence over the other keepers.  Not even my own son, Thorim, is bound to heed my commands.The Gjallarhorn comes from a time before our falling out, however.  A time of an ancient oath of honor.Let us invoke that oath -- I am certain Thorim will answer the call.",
