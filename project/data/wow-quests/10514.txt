What I am now is what matters and what I am now is a farmer.I use trained felboars to dig up tubers from the hardened earth of the Shattered Plains. Recently, though, flayers from a nest to the northeast have been attacking my animals, preventing me from gathering tubers.Would you go to the area north of here and gather tubers for me? Use this whistle while standing on a tuber mound and a boar will come dig one up!",
