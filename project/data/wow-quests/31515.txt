With her death, so goes the Crusade.To give her the final rest, we need two swords of legend, each with a lost but storied history.Luckily for me... er, us, these two blades of the anointed are at rest here within the monastery.Find them and once you've killed Whitemane, plunge the blades into her corpse to make the death permanent.",
