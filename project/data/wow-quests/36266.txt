Sadly, most of my supply was taken or destroyed in the recent attacks.The Shadowmoon cultists might think twice about stealing from us if you were to relieve them of their own resources.If you can collect some ceremonial Shadowmoon robes for me, I will demonstrate some of my favorite tailoring techniques for you.",
