And when the Darkmoon Faire closes, these grounds will be littered with tonk scrap.It'd be a shame to let all that good metal just sit in the dirt.If you help me collect some of the larger scraps, I can use them to reforge broken tonk parts. It's a lot less expensive than buying new metal every time. What do you say?",
