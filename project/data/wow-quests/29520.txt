It's my favorite part of setting up, but we have so many old and tattered ones that need to be replaced.If you've some skill with a needle and thread, would you mind making a banner from this kit and putting it up in some loose stones scattered around the grounds of the faire?It's missing a few pieces, but you should be able to get what you need from any trade goods vendor in Elwynn Forest or Mulgore.",
