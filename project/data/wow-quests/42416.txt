However, as he has proven his loyalty to the Kirin Tor many times, we must give him the benefit of the doubt for now. \r\n\r\nStill, I am obligated to share our concerns with the rest of the Council. You had best travel to Dalaran and meet with them in the Violet Citadel. I will remain here to care for our old friend.",
