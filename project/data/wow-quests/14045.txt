Do I look like a bundle of joy and good cheer, <name>?Longshore raided some of my most valuable cargo before his capture. Rumor has it he buried it before he was caught. I want my goods back! Find Longshore in the Alliance camp just south of here and see if you can get him to reveal where my treasure is.",
