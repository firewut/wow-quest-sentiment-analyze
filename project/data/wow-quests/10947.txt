The time has come to make our move.I've had a vision of an artifact that will aid us in our final struggle - the phylactery of a lich known as Winterchill.  Unfortunately its power was lost forever after his defeat in the Battle of Mount Hyjal.There might be a way to retrieve this artifact, however.  Legend speaks of a place in Azeroth guarded by bronze dragons...  a place where past and present meet.  It is there you will find what we seek.",
