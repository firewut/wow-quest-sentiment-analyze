They are apparently very strong, and secretive.\r\n\r\nIt's clear that, no matter what happens here in Kun-Lai, making an alliance with these Shado-Pan will be critical to our foothold in Pandaria.\r\n\r\nThat's where you come in. Rumor is they have a base of operations to the southeast, near Firebough Nook.\r\n\r\nYou will go there, and curry their favor. For the Horde!",
