He's the man I've put in charge of reforming a wing of gryphon riders from whatever scattered forces he can find. I would like you to help him.I should impress upon you the urgency of this task. We will not be able to hold here forever; the Twilight's Hammer or the Dragonmaw orcs will eventually overwhelm us. Putting together an active gryphon wing may be our only hope for surviving these conflicts.",
