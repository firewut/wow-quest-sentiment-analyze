If we are going to invade a demon world, we're going to have to make the command center jump-capable.\r\n\r\nWe need some replacement parts.\r\n\r\nLuckily for us, the Legion brought a couple of command centers and soul engines along with them to the Broken Isles. You will find them at Faronaar in Azsuna, and at Felsoul Hold in Suramar.",
