Thus, I will teach you how to enlist the help of one of nature's smallest creatures to do this task.By playing a simple rhythm on this drum, you can coax a marmot to follow your commands.There is a den of marmots near the Bloodmaul camp, to the north, down in the Daggermaw Canyon past the Circle of Blood.Once you have a marmot's aid, use it to disperse the poison to the Bloodmaul's kegs.",
