The problem is that the pouch is resting safely atop a tree stump amidst a sea of bloodthirsty man-killing worgs.You've got one shot to get that key without waking up any of those sleeping worgs. Head to the worg den and find a way into the center. Tread carefully and watch out for the Blackrock worg captain. Get the key and return to me.If you got a pet, I'd recommend telling it to stay back!",
