It doesn't sound good.The city of Andorhal is in the middle of a three-way war between the Forsaken, the Alliance, and the Scourge.  It sounds like Sylvanas has made her move, and to make matters interesting, she's put Koltira Deathweaver, the death knight, in command.They specifically asked for a Horde <class> to participate in some specialized missions.  If you accept the charge, speak to me again and I will prepare a portal.",
