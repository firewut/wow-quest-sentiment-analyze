By communion with animals and givin' them up to the spirits when needed, they give us divine guidance.  In times past, the haruspex's insight and wisdom gave us an edge in the wars against the splintered tribes of the Gurubashi.Bring me an offerin' of the Paragons of Power from inside Zul'Gurub and prove your worth to us.
