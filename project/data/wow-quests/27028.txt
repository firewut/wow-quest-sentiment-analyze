Daryl may like his boars, but the rest of us prefer things more exotic.Now, I'd never say the Loch draining was a good thing, but it did have a silver lining. The swampy ground's brought in new prey: Hornets!Giant hornets, mind you. Not many hunters have tussled with massive bugs before. It's rather novel.If you'd like to give it a try, I'll wager with you. Bring me back some of those nice glossy wings of theirs and I'll pay up.",
