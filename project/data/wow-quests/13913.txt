Most of the gnome team was taken as well. Now we're neck deep in Horde, Silverwind Refuge has been lost and we're down a dozen gnomes.I'm begging for your help here, <name>. Travel east to Silverwind Refuge and look for any gnome survivors. They were all carted off by a big, merciless orc named Thundrak. Find him and you'll find our gnomes.",
