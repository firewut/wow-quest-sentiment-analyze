    "description": "<name>, good to see you. While the battle has subsided for now, we must hurry and replenish our stocks. My research indicates that the armor of soldiers recently slain in the Glacial Falls becomes imbued with an incredible amount of energy. The Horde has been seen collecting armor in the area.Head to the Glacial Falls and slay any of the Horde you find there. Return their imbued armor to me.If you cannot find any of the Horde, you might find the armor of an adventurer slain by the elementals.",
