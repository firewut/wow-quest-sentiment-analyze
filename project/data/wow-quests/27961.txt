There's just no food for them to eat.  Now the nearby spiders - which were already dangerous - are getting big and fat on chicken meat.We'll never get rid of all the spiders, but we can salvage what few chickens remain.  Not only will you be feeding the Brotherhood, you'll be saving them a painful death by spider bite.",
