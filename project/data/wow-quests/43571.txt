Power begets power, Deathlord. Never forget this fact!I can forge an inseparable bond between rider and steed, but components of great power are required.The first item I require is the Braid of the Underking, a dark shamanic adornment passed down for generations.Currently, it is possessed by Dargrul the Underking.",
