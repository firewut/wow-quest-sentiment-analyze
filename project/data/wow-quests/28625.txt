Just west of town there's a grove of trees overlooking Lake Kel'theril. I don't know if it's the spooks there, or all that elf magic junk strewn around the place, but we've been getting treants and lashers wandering around there recently.They're making it a real pain to chop wood over there, so why don't you chop some of them? Bring the wood from the treants back here.",
