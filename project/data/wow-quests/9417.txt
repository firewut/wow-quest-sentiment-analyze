Lately they've taken to attacking Honor Hold patrols, which is why we were sent here.  See, Mirren and I are world-famous marksmen, we are!  But fowl and game are what we specialize in... not these... lightning-invoking birdmen.So what do you say you give us a hand in this one assignment?  You'll find the Den of Haal'esh to the southeast.",
