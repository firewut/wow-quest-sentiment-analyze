Once I stitch this pile of parts together I'm going to need a heart strong enough to pump sludge through this rat's nest of veins. I would use my own heart, but it's a shriveled up husk resembling a turnip.No, I need some real power. Get me a kodo heart from one of those giant landquaker bulls to the south of the Battlescar.",
