He sought my support, but I did not offer it. \r\n\r\nHe said my son's life would continue as normal... if I gave him my vote.\r\n\r\nThis morning my son was gone.\r\n\r\nI can only think of the terrible things he may be suffering. You know what this family is capable of!\r\n\r\nYou want my support, but I can do nothing while my son is in danger. Nothing.\r\n\r\nPlease... save him!",
