The visage of the robe is said to instill fear into the minds of all who see it... especially the demons that the demoniac will eventually dominate.From Zul'Gurub, you must bring me a very specific set of the Paragons of Power.  It will be difficult... but your success will assure you of acquiring a robe for yourself.",
