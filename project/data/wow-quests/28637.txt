I never had the chance to try it in Gilneas, but the bears here are simply exquisite.The shardtooth bears that roam just to the south are well-marbled with fat from the cold here. I've been hunting them myself, and it's quite a lark, but I much prefer eating them!I recommend you try your hand at the hunt. Stick to the white-pelted Shardtooth bears, and the Captain will go to field to bring back any you kill.",
