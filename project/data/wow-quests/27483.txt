Most revenge ploys are highly impractical.BUT... in this case - since you're already going to the ruins of Dalaran - you might as well kill every Dalaran affiliated human that you see. The reasons that I want them dead range from hatred to anger to betrayal, but I assure you they are all legitimate gripes. Do this for me and I will pay you handsomely.",
