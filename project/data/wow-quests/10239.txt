The blood elves, too, are troubled by them, but I'm not sure why.Whatever they're involved in over there, they don't seem to be stopping.

The most effective involves magical defenses fueled by some sort of concentrated energy.Capture some of these energy sources and bring them to me. Don't hesitate to stymie the elves if an opportunity presents itself.",
