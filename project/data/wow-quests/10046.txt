With so many soldiers and supplies, along with such a distinguished commander, they can only have one goal: Outland.The warchief sent an advance force through the portal, but if the Alliance believes there is a need for that many troops, perhaps we'd be wise to send our own reinforcements.Journey through the Dark Portal and report to Nazgrel at Thrallmar.",
