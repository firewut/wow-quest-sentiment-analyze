I've lost my sense of adventure.But you... remind me of my younger days; ready to take on the world with a sword in one hand and a skillet in the other.I want you to take my beloved cooking pot and head out to Blade's Edge.  Throw in some shortribs and crunchy serpent--already cooked for extra flavor--and broil it over an abyssal's corpse, the only thing hot enough to do the trick.",
