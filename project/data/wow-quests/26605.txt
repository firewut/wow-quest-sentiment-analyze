First I'm going to need some of my things.The gorillas and the monkeys on the other side of the island have taken most of my possessions.  I'll need my tiara, my scepter, my slippers, and my diary before I'm ready to leave.What?  Stop looking at me like I'm some sort of insane person.  You don't know what it's like being a princess.",
