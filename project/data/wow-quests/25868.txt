Yorla Darksnare is directing the Dark Iron dwarves from a camp to the east, and it might've been orders to have the gnolls steal Ironforge's gold in the first place.What's more, she's a wanted criminal... she's been inciting rebellion and attacks against Ironforge since Magni was still alive.She can't slip through our fingers this time, <name>.
