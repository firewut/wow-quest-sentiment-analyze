The same Edward Hanes that died of scurvy 20 years ago.This apparition told me a tale that made my heart tremble. A tale that I need you to hear and a mission that I need you to accomplish. Will you do it? Will you seek out Edward on Wyrmscar Island, northeast of your base?Regards,Admiral Odesyus\r\n",
