Someone decided to up and put a huge, dwarf-eating fish in the lake.It is strongly recommended that you stay out, however, if you are the heroic type and have a few friends around, do us all a favor and kill the damned thing! Maybe I can get some fishing done then, eh?If you manage to actually do it, meet me back at Windshear Hold for a reward.-Ol' Irongoat",
