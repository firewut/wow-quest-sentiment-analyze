If you can destroy the power core, it will cripple Dun Argol for some time.No power means no golems, no sentries, and no more lightning armaments.When we were sent up here, they told us these explosives were for excavation, but thanks to Iron Thane Furyhammer, the research has been scrapped. We may as well get some use out of them, though. They're the only thing we have on hand capable of destroying the power core.",
