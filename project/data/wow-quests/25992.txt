The naga took my armor and weapons, and left me with rags and a mining pick... and THAT snapped in half long ago.If we're to stand any hope of turning the tide, I'm going to need something to fight with... as will my companions, though they may be too proud to admit it.I've seen weapon racks in the naga storage areas nearby.  I'm not accustomed to fighting with a trident, but it'll sure be better than fighting with my fists.",
